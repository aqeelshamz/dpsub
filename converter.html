  const srt = `1
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,290
Hail Lord Ganesha!

2
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,250
A ritual once confined only
to Maharashtra and Bengal;

3
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,870
...now they've brought it here too.

4
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,580
Total crap!

5
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,950
The colour of our
English channel...

6
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,790
...and the colour of this
goddamn sea here. Terrible!

7
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,040
Drainage, waste, trash and what not!
Shucks!

8
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,500
And if they murder someone,
those corpses too..!

9
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,290
Even 'God' gets dumped
in this sea now.

10
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,290
It's a real tragedy, you know!

11
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,160
The eco-system is
totally gone!

12
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,200
-Hey Pawan!
-Yes, sir!

13
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,700
Clear everything. Not one speck
of trash should remain there.

14
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,250
He's calling it
trash, bloody dog!!

15
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,160
Did you hear me?

16
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,660
Forgive me, Lord Ganesha!

17
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,450
I heard you!

18
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,580
"I heard you, sir!"

19
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,870
"Heard you, sir!"

20
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,450
A sea that brings everything
from there over here.

21
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,620
Who's coming for dinner?

22
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,790
Who's coming for dinner?

23
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,830
Oh!

24
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,040
Parameshwaran Potty.

25
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,250
My old school friend.

26
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,950
You postponed our return
trip by three days,

27
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,450
saying that you have a most
important business meeting,

28
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,160
for this silly get-together?

29
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,830
That too, during this Covid pandemic?

30
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,120
It's not a silly get-together, Mythili..!!

31
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,790
It's a serious business meeting!

32
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,250
He's struggling now with
plenty of debts and losses.

33
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,410
I have to help him out.

34
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,370
We shouldn't forget our roots...

35
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,750
and our old friends too.

36
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,620
That's not an essential
Ramkumar line.

37
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,040
"Help", "Our roots"...

38
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,500
Without some kind of
prize money or trophy,

39
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,410
you don't take so
much effort usually.

40
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,870
My husband,
Mr. Ramkumar Nair.

41
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,950
Now, listen...

42
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,250
Just play the host well,
and do your damn business.

43
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,410
Got it?

44
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,200
There must be someone
else with him.

45
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,250
Huh?

46
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,290
Who is it?

47
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,790
Sir!

48
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,040
What is it?

49
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,950
Sir, can I ask you something?

50
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,750
Tell me.

51
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,120
You know...

52
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,080
My leader,

53
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,200
the most respected
Mr. Lakshman Kothadia,

54
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,660
is coming to this city today.

55
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,790
So?

56
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,910
If you give me permission,

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,830
I can go there.

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,950
Get lost!
We have guests coming today.

59
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,200
Go and do your work.

60
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,830
-Go!
--Okay, sir.

61
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,500
Bloody Pawanaputra Bhede!

62
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,660
His name sounds like some king who
fought and lost against the British.

63
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,950
He's named after our God.

64
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,000
Otherwise, I'd have
gone for his throat.

65
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,250
Hey Pawan!

66
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,750
Bring me a cup of tea!

67
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,620
Yes, sir!

68
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,500
âª This night, âª

69
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,750
âª This very night! âª

70
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,160
âª The moon was shattered, âª

71
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:23,000
âª And moonlight, erased, âª

72
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,290
Namaste, countrymen!

73
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,000
I am Arnab Goswami,

74
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,160
and you are watching,
"The Nation wants to know!"

75
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,080
My dear countrymen,

76
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,830
after eight days,

77
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,870
I have come out of the prison.

78
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,790
Hey! Can you reduce
the volume of the TV?

79
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,580
What, sir?

80
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,750
Can you reduce
the volume of the TV?

81
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,950
They won't listen to me, sir.

82
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,120
They are North Indians. They are our
only customers during this Covid period.

83
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,000
They don't need
music or dance now.

84
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,120
They just want to watch
that fellow!

85
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,580
Then... ask them to shout less!

86
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,870
If the cops come hearing this noise,
all of us will be thrown out.

87
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,160
You know, right?

88
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,500
Social distancing!

89
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,950
What social distancing, sir?

90
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,910
These guys have a
convention today,

91
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,200
at our boat house grounds.

92
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,410
They have come for that.

93
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,500
Please adjust, sir.

94
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,910
I can bring the drinks to
your room upstairs, sir.

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's alright.

96
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,700
Get me the bill.

97
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,290
And pack a pint bottle too.

98
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,700
Sir, you'll be checking
out tomorrow, right?

99
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,750
Yes.

100
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:28,000
âª This night, âª

101
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,200
âª This very night! âª

102
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:48,830
âª Where History once slept
and rose in peace.., âª

103
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:59,870
âª Recent wrongs
have castled up âª

104
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:13,410
âª Old wounds fester here, now, âª

105
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:21,410
âª By the salty waves
of the sea of sin... âª

106
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,620
âª On this night.., âª

107
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:34,500
âª Thisâ¦ very night! âª

108
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:52,080
âª If happenstanceâ¦
joins hands with destiny.., here, âª

109
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,250
âª Itâs Apocalypseâ¦! âª

110
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:05,500
âª That blood-stained finale, âª

111
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:11,700
âª itâd be unimaginable! âª

112
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:22,910
âª Suchâ¦ is the swelling
surge of the past.., âª

113
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:29,410
âª The battle song of Karma! âª

114
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,790
âª The end of story? âª

115
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:46,950
âª Beyond beliefâ¦.!!! âª

116
00:09:47,120 --> 00:10:00,620
âª Beyond beliefâ¦.!!! âª

117
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,950
âª This Night, âª

118
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:33,040
âª This very night! âª

119
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,040
âª The moon was shattered, âª

120
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,750
âª And moonlight, erased, âª

121
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,290
âª On this very nightâ¦! âª

122
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,410
I'll try asking here.

123
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,120
Brother, where can I
buy a lamp as a gift?

124
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,040
Go straight and then
take a right turn.

125
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,370
Straight and then right?

126
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,910
-Yes.
-Thank you.

127
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,870
Hey Potty!

128
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,120
Your Holiness!

129
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,370
Hey! Wear this mask!

130
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,410
Abdullah Marakkar!

131
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
Hey specso!

132
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,540
You little devil!

133
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,040
You and your mask!

134
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,290
A much more deadly virus
is right in front of you!

135
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,120
I saw a beautiful hand.

136
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,200
Must be your better half, right?

137
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,370
Hello!

138
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,580
-What's your name?
-Her name is...

139
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:39,950
Prabha.

140
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,830
He is an old friend of mine.

141
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Abdullah.

142
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
What?

143
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,950
Old friend of yours?

144
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,040
Are there 'old' and
'new' among friends?

145
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,160
Where are you going,
searching for a lamp?

146
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,160
I'm going for a colleague's
house-warming function.

147
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,450
That's why...

148
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,950
-Where are you based now?
-Thiruvananthapuram.

149
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,580
I came here to
attend this function.

150
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,250
Thiruvananthapuram?

151
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:09,950
If you have to fill petrol and drive all
the way till here from Thiruvananthapuram,

152
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,330
your colleague must
be no ordinary guy!

153
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,290
Well, he is a close friend.

154
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,910
Apart from me, you have
only one friend here, right?

155
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,950
That bugger!

156
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,950
That bloody son of a gun, Ramkumar.

157
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,700
But he has been in England
for the past 18 years.

158
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,200
This is another friend.

159
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,580
I told you, right?
My colleague.

160
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,290
How's your mother now?

161
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:37,950
Mother!

162
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,870
So, you remember....

163
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
right?

164
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,750
She died.... a week back.

165
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,580
Didn't you go to your hometown?

166
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,620
To the place where your
ancestral house stood?

167
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
What hometown!

168
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,500
It's all gone!

169
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,950
Wiped out!

170
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,250
When I got out of
the mental asylum,

171
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,040
the first thing they
told me was...

172
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,330
... not to go back
to old places.

173
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,580
Nostaliga is not meant
for lunatics, apparently.

174
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,500
Mental asylum?

175
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,370
But...

176
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,700
Abdu hasn't forgotten
old wounds, by the way.

177
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,200
I became a lunatic because
of that wound, right?

178
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,500
He's not here, right?

179
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,120
Who?

180
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,790
Ramkumar Nair.

181
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,580
Do you have his number?

182
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,660
No.

183
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,500
He had forgotten us
long back itself, right?

184
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,700
It's been around 12 years
since I spoke to him.

185
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,410
Even if you have his number,

186
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,410
I know that you
won't give it to me.

187
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,950
But you should inform him...

188
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:59,200
that my mother who trusted, fed and took
care of him and his father, is no more now.

189
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,750
Come, let's go!

190
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,120
Oops!

191
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,330
Hey Missus!

192
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,790
I am not a troublemaker.

193
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,330
You can buy the lamp
and go at your own pace.

194
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,660
I'm leaving.

195
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,200
I was just...

196
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,330
Brahmand Solutions.

197
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,040
That's an awesome name.

198
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,330
Is that your number?

199
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:22,830
No, no.

200
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,330
This one...
The office number is different.

201
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,160
Only the landline
is functioning now.

202
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,410
You bloody veggie!

203
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,040
Oh no!

204
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,160
Forgive me!

205
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,790
Please forgive me!

206
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,160
I didn't know!

207
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,330
Well, do we really
have to buy a lamp?

208
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,750
This is a business meeting, right?

209
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,950
Of course!
We have to!

210
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,540
Let his heritage resort
have a lamp from us.

211
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,080
Who is he?

212
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,870
Indecent fellow!

213
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,450
No mask... and he was
reeking of alcohol.

214
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,580
Ramkumar, Abdullah and I studied
together in Moothedath school here.

215
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,040
Have you studied here, Potty?

216
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,870
My father was the temple priest here
at a Lord Narasimha temple, long back.

217
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,790
I studied here from my
4th to 10th grades.

218
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,500
You're still sweating quite a bit.

219
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,620
No way!

220
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,620
Seems like he was the
school bully back then.

221
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,120
-You got scared, right?
-By bully, you mean?

222
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,910
Rowdy!

223
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,410
Oh! That bully!

224
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,450
When he asked you about Ramkumar,

225
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,450
why did you lie to him?

226
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,700
Err... Well...

227
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,040
It will be a
problem if I say it.

228
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,410
Why should I...

229
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,450
Don't go there and say that we
met Abdullah on the way, okay?

230
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,200
I won't say anything.

231
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,160
What was the issue between them?

232
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,410
Tell me that story.
I'm getting bored.

233
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,410
Dad!

234
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,200
Read what's written on that poster.

235
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,370
Poster of the movie 'Midhunam'

236
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,160
Don't humiliate me, Abdu.

237
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,450
Please try, Dad.

238
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,620
The first letter is 'M'.

239
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,160
The second letter...

240
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,620
... looks like Taj Mahal
turned upside down. Doesn't it?

241
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,830
Do you like Mammookka (Mammootty)
or Lalettan (Mohanlal), Uncle?

242
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,250
Nothing like that, son. If they act
well, I like both Ikka and Ettan.

243
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,580
Whom do you like?

244
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,250
I like Rajinikanth!

245
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,450
-Wasn't it Kamal Haasan?
-Well, I changed sides.

246
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,830
Why?

247
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,330
Style!

248
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,080
Isn't that Mr. Nair?

249
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,330
Yes, Dad.

250
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,000
Come and get in, Nair.

251
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,160
Ah! Basheerkka!

252
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,330
- Come, Rama.
- No, Dad! Let's keep walking.

253
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,450
Come on!

254
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,660
-Abdu, you go to the back seat.
-Okay, Dad.

255
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,700
Hey! We were on our way there.

256
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,200
-Abdu!
-Yes!

257
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,120
Rama... Come, get inside.

258
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,540
All of you are here, huh?

259
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,120
-No. I'll get in through the other side.
-Okay.

260
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,450
His bloody car!
Show-off!

261
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,500
My umbrella!

262
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,750
Peace be unto you, Basheerkka.

263
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,200
You needn't greet
me like that, Nair.

264
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,700
You can say Namaste.

265
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,330
If so... Eid Mubarak, Basheerkka.

266
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,160
Eid Mubarak!

267
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,830
Raman gets chicken biriyani
only once in a year,

268
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,080
for this festival of yours.
Right, son?

269
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,500
Advocate Menon must
have reached, right?

270
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,080
Yes, Menon has reached.

271
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,120
I came out with Abdu,
making Menon wait at home.

272
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,080
Abdu couldn't go to school for the
past two weeks, due to typhoid.

273
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,410
So, he wanted to get some
notebooks from Potty.

274
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,700
On the way back, I
brought Potty also along.

275
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,750
Potty?
Is the High Priest home?

276
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,250
No. He has gone to the temple.

277
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,250
-Oh.
-It's the temple festival, Nair.

278
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,700
Don't you remember all this?

279
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,870
Where do I have the time
to think about all this?

280
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,410
I'm neck deep in debts.

281
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,750
You know, right?

282
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,910
Dad, they are here.

283
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,080
Allah!

284
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,250
Hey Kalyanam!

285
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,330
Don't call him that!

286
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,750
Kalyan.
That's his name.

287
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,910
Dad let me bring
the bat and ball.

288
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,290
Come, let's play.

289
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,790
Menon!

290
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,370
Did you get bored,
sitting alone?

291
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,580
-No.
-Come. Come, Nair.

292
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,330
-Rehana, Aisha..
-Yes, Mom!

293
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,540
What is it, Mom?

294
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,620
-Take this there, children.
-I'll take this.

295
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,660
Don't take that.

296
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:23,000
-Here, take this.
-I'll take this.

297
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,370
Rehana, serve Sarbath to them.

298
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,120
Which country is this
company from, Nair?

299
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,700
Advocate...

300
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,200
France.

301
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,910
-The name is Accadio.
-Oh God!

302
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,120
All over the world,

303
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,500
in all the seven continents,
they have hotels.

304
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,450
They are coming to our town too.

305
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,250
Isn't that a matter of pride, Ikka?

306
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,750
I like mutton.

307
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,290
But since you people prefer chicken,
we decided to go with Chicken Biriyani.

308
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,370
Where is Potty?

309
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,160
Different people have
different habits, right?

310
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,200
We shouldn't feed
the priest's son,

311
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:05,200
at a table where we're having
mutton, chicken and beef.

312
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,790
He's having his
vegetarian lunch inside.

313
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,160
Did you take your medicine?

314
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,290
Hey!

315
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
Have your lunch, son.

316
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,620
Give him this glass of water.

317
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,370
Have your food, Nair.

318
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,620
Ikka...

319
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,080
The party from
France has arrived.

320
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,080
They are staying at a
big hotel in Kozhikode.

321
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,700
Once you nod yes,
they will be here.

322
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:40,000
They have brought a white lady,
especially for this.

323
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,290
-Some more?
-No.

324
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,500
If it happens,

325
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,040
this will be their
first venture in Kerala.

326
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,330
And you will be the one who
benefits from this, Basheerkka.

327
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,500
Your entire future will
be secured in one go.

328
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,870
I'm aware of that.

329
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,620
But it's the land where my
ancestral house stood, Menon.

330
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,370
It's around 400 years old.

331
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,580
You know, right?

332
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,700
Jumma prayers were
offered here, earlier.

333
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,870
The property is only around 8 acres.

334
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,080
That's the only asset I can
leave behind for my children.

335
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,160
I have two daughters!

336
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,120
And I have a heart problem too.

337
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,410
We're hungry, Mother!

338
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,410
I feel really exhausted
while walking now.

339
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,450
We've been seeing each other

340
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,040
since the time we were running
around in our underpants, Basheerkka.

341
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,500
Do you have to explain
all this to us?

342
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,540
Right, Menon?

343
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,830
They just need the four acres
of land by the beach.

344
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,660
And you'll get a good price too.

345
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,250
You can use it to
buy another property,

346
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,290
or deposit it in a bank.

347
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,290
However you look at it,
it's profitable.

348
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,540
If not anything else,

349
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,250
if you want to use that
money to renovate this house,

350
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,290
you can do that too.

351
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,200
There's no point holding on saying
that it's a heirloom, Basherrkka.

352
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,870
If you can't maintain
it properly,

353
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,790
all this is just stone and sand.

354
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,450
Don't worry, Basheerkka.

355
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,620
What's the revenue that
this property generates now?

356
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,540
Just the coconuts and shoots
from these odd coconut trees.

357
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,950
If you want to chop off all these
coconut trees at this old age,

358
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,660
and start cultivating new crops,

359
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,410
it's not possible because
the wind here is salty.

360
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,290
Though you're a Marakkar,

361
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,540
since you've never
really gone to sea,

362
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,290
even fishing business
won't work for you.

363
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,080
That's true.

364
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,000
The foreigners have come
here especially because...

365
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,950
this property has
such a beach frontage.

366
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,500
When there's such an opportunity,

367
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,160
if you don't sell it for a good price,

368
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,620
you'd regret it later on.

369
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,950
I'll tell you one thing.

370
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,080
The coastal rules are going to change.

371
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,790
That's why the foreigners
are in a hurry.

372
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,080
Once the law changes,
not just them...

373
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,870
Even we can't do anything.

374
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,370
If they leave, you won't get a fair
price for that part of your land.

375
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,450
Remember that!

376
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,580
That's not what I'm thinking about.

377
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,160
I wanted to ask this to you.

378
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:15,290
How come the foreigners decided
to buy this, all of a sudden?

379
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,200
That's something which
hasn't happened so far.

380
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,290
Oh! So you didn't know?

381
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:21,910
No.

382
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,250
Who is our Prime Minister now?

383
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,660
Narasimha Rao.

384
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:33,870
He has initiated an exuberant phase which
has never happened in this country so far.

385
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,540
Have you heard about 'globalisation'?

386
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,660
No.

387
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,000
Globalisation means that...

388
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,040
One.

389
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,200
The foreigners will
give us cash in hand,

390
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,330
to run their business
in our country.

391
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,580
Two.

392
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:55,160
We accept that money and run the
foreigners' empire, right here.

393
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,660
Three.

394
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,330
It will fill the pockets of the
foreigners and us, at the same time.

395
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,160
That is globalisation.

396
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,250
How is Narasimha Rao?

397
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:08,080
How's that?

398
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,040
But... like Musaliyar said...

399
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,250
this Rao just watched
silently with his hands tied,

400
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,700
when that mosque was demolished.

401
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,580
How can he be at fault for that?

402
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,660
If so many people make up their mind
to do it, what can the Government do?

403
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,870
Enough, sister.
My stomach is full.

404
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,450
Aisha! Careful.

405
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,950
Aisha, dear...

406
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,160
Rehana...
Come here, girls.

407
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,000
Wear your Hijab properly,
clean your hands and go.

408
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,870
Whom do you wish
to marry, Rehana?

409
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,540
Aamir Khan.

410
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,750
-What about you, Aishu?
-Salman Khan.

411
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,250
You needn't take Muslim names alone,
out of your fear for me.

412
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,160
Take the names you really like.

413
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,500
-Shall I say it?
-No.

414
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,870
-Shall I say it?
-No.

415
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,660
She likes Aravind Swamy.

416
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,790
-Who is he?
-I have no idea!

417
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,290
Heard their wishes?

418
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:17,620
Is it possible...

419
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,290
... if you hold on to this field which
has only weeds, bushes and dry coconuts?

420
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,330
Hey Ram!
Throw it at his leg.

421
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,750
Come on!

422
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,160
Throw it!

423
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,000
Come on, Ram!

424
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:32,290
Pace! Pace!
Malcolm Marshall.

425
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,540
You're finished, Abdullah!

426
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,370
We are with you, right?

427
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,120
We just need your
signature, Ikka.

428
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,370
And you needn't do it blindly.

429
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,250
We'll bring the agreement,

430
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,080
and Advocate Menon will read out
every word and every letter to you.

431
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,910
You need to sign it only if you're
satisfied after listening to it.

432
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,580
I told you, right?

433
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,910
If this sale happens,
it will benefit us too.

434
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,450
Even after all these years,
I'm still not well settled, Ikka.

435
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,450
My only house is mortgaged.

436
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:06,700
I can't afford the rent of the
house in which I'm staying now.

437
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,580
I'm sinking!

438
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,200
Neck deep in debts!

439
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,750
I need to save Ram at least.

440
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,370
How's that?

441
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,120
And then?

442
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,790
Then... nothing more!

443
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,040
Ramkumar's resort where we're headed
to now, is situated on that property.

444
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,660
When we go there with this lamp,

445
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,660
he will instantly understand that we're
going there after talking about all this.

446
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,950
He's a bloody shark!

447
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,000
So, forget whatever
I told you so far.

448
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,580
Yeah, right!

449
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,040
As if I have no other job than
remembering this flashback!

450
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,540
We're neck deep in debts.

451
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,580
I just hope Ram makes
a huge investment.

452
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,580
Then, don't ask me anything
more about the past.

453
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,580
Understood?

454
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,700
Don't tell him that we
met Adullah Marakkar.

455
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,910
You make sure that you
don't blurt it out.

456
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:27,950
Me?

457
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,160
So...

458
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,700
where are those two girls?

459
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,290
I don't know!

460
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:40,620
Where was Abdullah working?

461
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,250
He was in Mumbai.

462
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,330
He was in a mental
asylum, apparently.

463
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,580
It would be a surprise
if he didn't go crazy.

464
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,200
Tall, Latino,

465
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,830
Ebony, Dusky,

466
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:13,870
MILF...

467
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,830
These are your current favourites, right?

468
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,120
Fair enough!

469
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,870
Or rather,

470
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,040
unfair enough.

471
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,290
Psst!

472
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,910
Is this why you said that this one's
better than the resort at Southampton?

473
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,580
We don't have to give the parasailing
option to the guests here.

474
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,120
That's for sure.

475
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,410
The mosquitoes can
take them parasailing.

476
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,290
The window netting team will
come day after tomorrow.

477
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,410
I've arranged it.

478
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,790
My dear man,

479
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:49,040
our first customers are
coming this weekend.

480
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,370
It's a high profile entry.

481
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,080
I'll manage that.
You don't worry.

482
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:55,250
I have to worry
and I will worry.

483
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:01,000
Accadio looks for my signature
in the quality check documents.

484
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
Not yours.

485
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,790
Is it?

486
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:04,870
If that's the case,

487
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,830
you've taken the quotation for
the CCTV installation, right?

488
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,370
What's happening with that?

489
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,200
Isn't it part of quality check?

490
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,370
Isn't that a basic need
of a luxurious resort

491
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,750
which has relics worth at
least a millon dollars?

492
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,290
I'll get it installed.

493
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:22,040
But that will be the
least of my priorities.

494
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,830
First, you install a mosquito net.

495
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,040
I'll get the CCTV
installed after that.

496
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,500
Bloody shit!

497
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,120
Accadio Saket.

498
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,580
What must be the meaning of it?

499
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,250
Accadio is a French word.

500
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,620
Saket is a Sanskrit word.

501
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
He's quite impressive!

502
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,620
Isn't anybody around?

503
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,080
Let me check.

504
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:12,870
Hello!

505
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,620
Hello!

506
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,450
Hail Lord Ram!

507
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,500
Yes.
Ram!

508
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,620
Is he inside?

509
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,700
-He was just greeting you.
-Is it?

510
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,790
Park the car over there.

511
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,370
-Over there?
-Yes.

512
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,830
I understood what he said.

513
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,330
I was just pulling his leg.

514
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,830
You didn't get that, huh?

515
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,410
I did! You're lucky that
he didn't pull your leg!

516
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:48,910
Potty...

517
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,160
Don't take that lamp now.

518
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,540
We can ask the watchman to
bring it if required.

519
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:56,450
Hello brother!

520
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,290
Give me time for two more days.

521
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,700
I've come to Vadakara
to make an arrangement.

522
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,580
No. I'll do it.
Definitely!

523
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,120
Sorry!

524
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,290
Hello, Your Holiness!

525
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,580
-I'll call you back!
-Mr. Curd Rice!

526
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,370
Ram!

527
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,040
Long time!

528
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,950
This is my wife, Prabha.

529
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,410
-Hello.
-Hey Prabha!

530
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,580
How are you?

531
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,160
Fine.

532
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,540
-You look gorgeous.
-Thank you.

533
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,540
Don't I always tell you
to wear the Sari properly?

534
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,870
Didn't you see how
he was looking?

535
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:35,080
He's just named Ram.
He's actually a Ravan.

536
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,500
-What?
-Well...

537
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:39,370
It's quite a costly construction.

538
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,660
-Costly!
-Let that be!

539
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,620
- Is this your car?
-Yes.

540
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,080
-Pathetic!
-Why?

541
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,080
How will you impress
top-tier business clients,

542
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,950
without a premium sedan, at least?

543
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,910
You're still the
same old miser, huh?

544
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,790
What's that lamp
on the back seat?

545
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,080
We bought it for our house.

546
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,080
There's a really nice
shop in the market here.

547
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,790
-If you like it, you can take it.
-Get lost!

548
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,580
I don't allow such cheap items
even anywhere near this place.

549
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,080
Come, I wanna show
you something.

550
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,580
Welcome... .. to the Accadio Saket!

551
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,330
Thank you, dear!

552
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,450
We are the number one luxury
stay chain in the world.

553
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,950
ACS, Bechtel, Vinci and Skanska...

554
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,330
... come only after us.
- Is it?

555
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,830
We focus on sea-side properties.

556
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:23,290
We have 116 coastal home-stay
properties currently.

557
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:24,120
Superb!

558
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,250
Across the world!

559
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,700
-The sun never sets on the Accadio Saket!
-Wonderful.

560
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,040
Those who come here,

561
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,540
walk along with history,

562
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,660
breathe history,

563
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:32,830
eat along with history,

564
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,040
and sleep with history.

565
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,580
Hey! Do you know the
tariff here for one night?

566
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,000
3 Lakhs plus taxes.

567
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,000
You won't understand
all that, you Veggie!

568
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,910
It's a million dollar game!

569
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:45,950
Everything you see here...

570
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,330
... are historical relics.

571
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,620
Very very costly,

572
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,450
and specially curated
for the Accadio Saket.

573
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,580
Like our tagline suggests,

574
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,160
the guests pay us to
'Stay among the relics'.

575
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,580
Wow!

576
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,910
-Beautiful.
-Yes!

577
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,000
-These are?
-See!

578
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,080
To understand style and substance,
you need a classy eye.

579
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,250
I like that!

580
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,250
See this! This is from
Chandragupta Maurya's period.

581
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,410
We have twelve of them,
on either side of the pathway.

582
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,790
Saw that?

583
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,250
It's from Krishnadevarayar's period.

584
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,040
Come!

585
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,250
There's much more to see!

586
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,950
Wow! Hey!

587
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,830
This! This is awesome!

588
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Broken Ganesha!

589
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,120
Superb design!

590
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,870
I love modern art!

591
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,660
This is true art!

592
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,370
Must be imported
from America, right?

593
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,290
Get lost.
This is not modern art!

594
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,330
Hey Pawan!

595
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,290
-Pawan!
-Yes, sir!

596
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,950
Take this away!

597
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,620
Put it in the basket and
keep it on your head.

598
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,160
I was going to throw it, sir.

599
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,120
-What?
-I was going to throw it.

600
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:42,000
Then go and throw it, you ass!

601
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,040
You come!
Bloody Ganesh Visarjan!

602
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,290
Now it's here too!

603
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:48,370
Its hands, head, trunk,
rat, Laddoos and what not,

604
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:50,200
are lying all over
my private beach.

605
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:52,540
I asked him to throw it away
and he has kept it here.

606
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,620
*******!

607
00:33:58,910 --> 00:33:59,910
Come!

608
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,250
-Ram, should I remove my shoes?
-No, come.

609
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,540
What is this?
A museum?

610
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,750
Hey! Here's our guest for the night.

611
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:11,660
-Hello!
-Hi!

612
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,330
-Parameshwaran Potty, right?
-Yes.

613
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:14,660
Potty, this is Mythili.

614
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:15,870
This is his wife, err...

615
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,290
Prabha!

616
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,000
Can you please take them around?

617
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,790
-I'll take this call and come.
-Sure.

618
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,830
Hello!

619
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,910
Please come.
You can see the interiors.

620
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:27,290
Mythili... this?

621
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,870
The Greek Thinker.

622
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,660
It's the only other
replica of the thinker.

623
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:33,120
This is from Accadio's
original collection.

624
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,330
Okay.

625
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:36,750
Everything else was
procured by us at Saket.

626
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:40,080
These relics are Accadio Saket's USP.

627
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,790
Our priceless relics gallery.

628
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,120
Incidentally,

629
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,330
this is the Accadio-Saket
partnership's vanguard property.

630
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,370
Oh, I see!

631
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:48,660
Yeah, yeah!
I'll meet them.

632
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:49,910
-Come.
-Yeah, sure.

633
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,120
Now I'll show them around.

634
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,580
You may please go and...

635
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,830
... get something to drink.

636
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,500
-Come.
-Hey Ram!

637
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:59,450
This one?

638
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,620
This is...

639
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,080
This is Hitler, right?

640
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,660
Yes.
Made in wax!

641
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,580
Who's this bald head?

642
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:11,870
Benito Mussolini.

643
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,410
These guys had killed
a lot of people, right?

644
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,290
Hey! It's a really bad omen...

645
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:20,120
... to place these guys at the entrance.
-What do you even know?

646
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,620
-Have you heard their speeches?
-Yeah, right!

647
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,250
"Bhaiyon aur Behanon"

648
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,750
No one can beat that!

649
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:26,910
Get lost!

650
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:27,950
-I'm sorry.
-Come.

651
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:31,950
Mahatma Gandhiji.

652
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,700
Hey! Aren't these Gandhiji's spectacles?

653
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:38,000
Yes! I bought it
during an action....

654
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,040
... for 350,000 Dollars.
-Oh!

655
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,580
This is an ancient statue.

656
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,500
An extremely rare piece of art.

657
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,950
Wow!
Che Guvera!

658
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,870
What's this vanity
bag doing here?

659
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,330
It's a backpack he used
when he was in Bolivia.

660
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,250
I bought it when I got
it for a good price.

661
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,950
Just 250,000 Dollars.

662
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Wow!

663
00:35:58,830 --> 00:35:59,870
Safdar Hashmi.

664
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,580
There's a lot to say about him.

665
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,250
But this is the pen he used,
while he was working in Economic Times.

666
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:06,540
A very valuable piece!

667
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,120
This is awesome!
This is a great omen!

668
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,040
You should be keeping
this at your entrance!

669
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,870
Lord Krishna!
Bless me!

670
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:18,450
You idiot!
This is not Lord Krishna!

671
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,290
This is NTR.
NT Rama Rao.

672
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:23,200
This is a famous character he played.

673
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,750
He became the Chief Minister
twice in Andhra, doing all this.

674
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,750
You are too much!

675
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:29,700
-So he was a Chief Minister too?
-No! Panchayat President!

676
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,120
Hey! Don't touch that!

677
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,830
-Don't touch!
-I won't.

678
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,290
These are all antiques from Africa,
that are worth several Lakhs.

679
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,370
-If they fall..
- What's this?

680
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,370
Hey! No!

681
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,450
It's just an extension.

682
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,040
-Come.
-Keep a distance from him.

683
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,500
The coin used by THE Amitabh Bachchan
in the movie, Sholay.

684
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,370
You've seen it only
in the movie, right?

685
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,370
In real!

686
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:51,080
The dagger used by Jhansi Rani,
to kill the British.

687
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,370
This is it.

688
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,790
This is my hero!

689
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,330
Can you say who it is?

690
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:01,790
Who is it?

691
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,370
-Stalin!
-Oh yeah!

692
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,450
Karunanidhi's son!

693
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,080
You...

694
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:09,580
How do you run a company without
a minimum general knowledge?

695
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:14,450
And this is the legendary
Dhyan Chand Singh's hockey stick.

696
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,160
Wow! Cricket bat!

697
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:22,330
Hey! This is the bat with which
Kapil Dev scored 175 not out,

698
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:24,580
against Zimbabwe in the
Prudential Cup, 1983.

699
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,370
Phew! You know at least that, huh?

700
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,450
-Did you tell him anything?
-No.

701
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,250
See! We won't get a chance after this.
I have to go back.

702
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:35,000
-Please!
-I don't know!

703
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
I will tell him.
But you have to...

704
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,500
What game is this?

705
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,160
What?

706
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:43,120
This is a game played
by the Americans, right?

707
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,000
That?
It's baseball, you idiot.

708
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,450
Sundown, guests!

709
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,370
-Let there be light!
-It's sunset.

710
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,370
I'll show you our night mode now.

711
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,080
Wow!

712
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,160
Peter Hofer.

713
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,660
Special... double barrel gun?

714
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:30,370
Ram... 224,000 Dollars?

715
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:31,830
Really?

716
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,870
This is an isolated place, right?

717
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,080
I bought it for self-protection.

718
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,450
It's part of my personal collection.

719
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,750
Hey! It's fully loaded.

720
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:43,950
Don't play with it.

721
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,410
Idiot!

722
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:48,540
You carry on.

723
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,120
We're currently a partnership
company incorporated in 2014,

724
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,410
...based in Trivandrum.
-Yeah, fine.

725
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,580
We have an annual turnover of
1 Crore in the last three years.

726
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,250
Dude, do you remember...

727
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,870
...Uncle Basheer's
Tipu Sultan gun?

728
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,200
But it was smaller
than this one, right?

729
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
That reminds me!

730
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,450
I forgot to show you someone.

731
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,500
Come!
One second.

732
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Cheers!

733
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,370
Come.

734
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,080
-Hello guests.
-Oh my God!

735
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,080
My name is Anastasia Aubert.

736
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:48,580
and I am the founder, initiator
of the Accadio homestay network.

737
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,500
It's a hologram.

738
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,290
One of the world's largest luxury..

739
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,580
Oh my God!

740
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:55,040
This is the old white lady
who came that day, right?

741
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:56,950
What is this, man?

742
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,000
The same hairstyle.

743
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,120
The same frock.

744
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,700
The same stance.

745
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:04,410
Oh my God!

746
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,790
Hey! You haven't
changed at all, huh?

747
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,410
You're still that
old country bumpkin!

748
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,830
-Goodbye. Au revoir.
-Wait.

749
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,700
Look at this.

750
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,700
This is the Accadio Saket fun room.

751
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,870
You can see many
wonders like this here.

752
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,620
Come, let's talk serious business now.

753
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
So that's the plan.

754
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,700
A profitable revamp of your software setup,

755
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,910
with clientele predominantly in the U.S.,

756
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:39,700
Germany and U.K.

757
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,910
-Yes.
-Precisely, Ram.

758
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,330
I'll tell you something frankly.

759
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,040
My business has grown so much...

760
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,250
... because of my shrewdness.

761
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,580
Of course,
Mythili's money back-up too.

762
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,040
Coming back to our point.

763
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,200
What is your qualification
to run this business?

764
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,410
I have studied B.Com.

765
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,830
And I've done MBA too.

766
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:04,790
You're referring to the degree from
some cheap college in Nagercoil as MBA?

767
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,540
There's no M, B or A there.
So, forget that.

768
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:08,870
Then...

769
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,870
I've noticed it whenever
I chat with you.

770
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,580
Your English is abysmally poor.

771
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,160
Have your drink.

772
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,250
Brahmand Solutions.

773
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,580
-Who named it?
-Me.

774
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,700
I knew it.

775
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,910
You should change this
disgusting name first.

776
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,790
There's a way to do all this.

777
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,540
Anyway, forget it now.

778
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,500
I'll suggest a name.

779
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,330
Bram Solutions!

780
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:40,700
-But Brahma..
-Splendid!

781
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,000
Wow!
Thank you.

782
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,830
By the way, who among you is
planning to be the CEO?

783
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:47,870
Me.

784
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,410
What a successful
CEO needs the most,

785
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:56,120
is an impressive command
over two European languages,

786
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,160
other than English.

787
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,370
And last but not the least,

788
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:01,290
a rock solid personality!

789
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,700
Don't get me wrong, Potty.

790
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,200
You don't have any of this.

791
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:09,910
If so,

792
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:13,700
the most worthless person on this earth,
would be Stephen Hawking.

793
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,120
He's a scientist, damn it!

794
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:17,910
Let's start with his name!

795
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:19,540
Parameshwaran Potty.

796
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,080
How do you spell it in English?

797
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,750
P-O-T-T-Y.

798
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:25,330
Just like I thought!

799
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:29,450
Dude, 'Potty' has two
meanings in English.

800
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:30,830
One.

801
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:32,540
The thing in which
children take a shit.

802
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:34,830
Two.

803
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:35,870
An imbecile.

804
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,250
I'm serious!

805
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,080
Moreover,

806
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,700
westerners never prefer...

807
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,120
... open ending names which end
with sounds like 'E' and 'Oo'.

808
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,200
Ramkumar, Mythili Ram.

809
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,950
Short and pronounceable.

810
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,290
What's your full name, Prabha?

811
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,580
Prabha Nair.

812
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,080
-Are you a Nair?
-Yes.

813
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,330
-Wow!
-There are exceptions even among that.

814
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,790
Narayana Swamy, Sundar Pichai,
Ambani, Adani...

815
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,290
These are all 'E's and 'Oo's, right?

816
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:03,410
We're talking about the CEO
of a software company now.

817
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,040
A company which I am
supposed to be investing in.

818
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,250
If I don't have confidence,
I won't invest.

819
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:12,160
Be it a friend, colleague or even
my father. That's what I'll do.

820
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,080
Talking of your
father reminds me...

821
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:17,830
When your father got the documents
of this property written in his name,

822
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:19,040
from our old Uncle Basheer...

823
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:22,250
He didn't think of continents
or confidence like this.

824
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:24,080
Not continents.
Countenance!

825
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,410
Well, I was just saying.

826
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:27,620
Mythili, if I tell you about
what happened back then,

827
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,540
I can't imagine what
will happen here.

828
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:32,290
It will be a floccinaucinihilipilification.

829
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,660
What?

830
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:36,750
He has been listening to Shashi Tharoor's
speeches all the time lately,

831
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,410
to improve his English.

832
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,790
Uncle Basheer?

833
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,290
Does this place
have such a history?

834
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,160
You didn't tell me.

835
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,330
Who's this Basheer?

836
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:51,200
Well, this 'Sanket' of yours?

837
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,290
-Saket!
-Yes, whatever.

838
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:55,200
-Long before this came into being.
-Shucks!

839
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:56,450
Those are all old stories!

840
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,540
Forget all that, Potty.

841
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,330
Please don't subvert the topic.

842
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:00,700
I was saying that...

843
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:02,250
I am ready to help you.

844
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,040
But I'm not ready to
forget my profit motive.

845
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,750
I'm a businessman.
That's all.

846
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:07,830
Hey Mythili...

847
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,580
Back in the day, he cleared his
exams from 4th to 10th grade,

848
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:13,000
copying my notes
and answer sheets.

849
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,540
-There's not doubt about that anyway!
-See!

850
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:16,910
It's not 'not doubt'.

851
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,290
-'No doubt'!
-Didn't I say so?

852
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:19,330
No!

853
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,700
If you have a doubt,
ask Prabha.

854
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,620
You said 'not doubt'.

855
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:26,950
Have your drink.

856
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:28,410
I will drink.

857
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:31,750
I'll do one thing.

858
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,080
I'll bring some snacks.

859
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,120
You guys talk.

860
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:49,330
I will invest...

861
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,620
... on one condition.

862
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:53,000
Prabha should be the CEO.

863
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:54,950
She's elegant,

864
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,160
articulate,

865
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,160
and good looking.

866
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:58,620
What say?

867
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:17,450
What is this?

868
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,160
I'm asking you!

869
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:21,620
Go hunting!

870
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,120
But even that has some ethics.

871
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:24,950
You need to have that.

872
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,080
Is your childhood friend's wife
your next target?

873
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,450
We owe 2.5 Crores to the bank.

874
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,580
Our house and office are
facing a seizure notice.

875
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:38,500
Ram is offering us 3 Crores
without charging any interest.

876
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,700
We don't have any other option.

877
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:44,080
So, please don't create
an unnecessary scene here.

878
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,500
I know he is flirting with me.

879
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:49,540
I know how to manage that.

880
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:53,750
That's all you have left to do.

881
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,160
Go ahead!
Get drunk!

882
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:03,250
When you went on a
solo trip to Amsterdam,

883
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,660
did I ask you who the
playboy with you was?

884
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:06,870
No.

885
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:09,370
When you were at Norway countryside
for two months with a Negro...

886
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:10,410
Oh! Sorry!

887
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:11,700
That's politically incorrect.

888
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,040
You stayed with a 'man of
colour' for two months.

889
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,540
Did I ask you anything?
No!

890
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,950
So I will do whatever I
want with my friend's wife,

891
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,830
or with my aunt's daughter!

892
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:22,330
Can you ask anything?

893
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:23,790
No!

894
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:25,870
So just shut your mouth up!

895
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:29,620
These are the privileges
of being affluent and rich!

896
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:32,250
Please enjoy it... and
let others also enjoy.

897
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:33,700
Okay?

898
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,580
I can't tolerate this.

899
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:47,910
Do whatever you want!

900
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:54,950
Err.. Toilet?

901
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:57,540
Over there... in the fun room.

902
00:46:58,540 --> 00:46:59,540
Potty...

903
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:03,790
I'm sorry.

904
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,160
You bloody son of a gun, Potty!

905
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,910
In the name of saving your business,

906
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,250
you took Rs. 75 Lakhs from
me and screwed me over!

907
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,370
No capital, no interest either!

908
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:10,540
Can't you just pimp your
wife instead, you scumbag?

909
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:11,540
Hey Potty!

910
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,370
It's me, Abdu.

911
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:17,080
I don't have any
issue with you, dude!

912
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:21,660
I know that your dad, the High Priest,
had a part to play in this betrayal!

913
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:25,870
But I can forgive that, since it was
just a hapless Priest's desperation...

914
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,790
...resulting in unintended evil.

915
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,950
My issue is with the other guy!

916
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:33,950
That bloody son of a gun, Ram.

917
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,080
I want to see him.

918
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,370
But... not to give him a hug.

919
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:42,450
You heard me?

920
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:43,910
See you sometime!

921
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,160
This is my number.

922
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,870
You can save it,
if you really want to!

923
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,410
Mythili, where is Prabha?

924
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:06,870
Upstairs, with Ram.

925
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:07,950
Upstairs?

926
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,790
-Come, sit.
-No, it's okay.

927
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:11,330
How do I go upstairs?

928
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:12,870
End of the hall, at the left,
you'll see the staircase.

929
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:13,540
That way?

930
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:14,580
-Yes.
-Okay.

931
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:02,580
Another one!

932
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:04,040
Sex is also like money.

933
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:06,000
Only too much is enough!

934
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:08,160
And even when it's bad,

935
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,200
it's good!

936
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:13,830
Hey Potty!

937
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,500
Come!

938
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:21,700
Look!
The night sea!

939
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:23,500
It's a magnificent view from here.

940
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:25,500
Enjoy the view.
I'll make a call and come.

941
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,620
Okay?

942
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:35,200
You knew him already, right?

943
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:36,580
What is this, Potty?

944
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,200
He is a business
development consultant.

945
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:42,330
A leading venture capitalist, as well.

946
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:46,330
We've been chatting
for the past two years...

947
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:47,790
... on Instagram.

948
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,830
Did you think he'll contact
you out of the blue?

949
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:55,910
Has Ram called you
in the past 12 years?

950
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,200
So...

951
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:00,040
did he chat with me,
because you told him to?

952
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,450
Did he invite me because
you asked him to?

953
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,500
Yes!

954
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,450
But I know where to draw the line.

955
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:08,660
You don't worry.

956
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:15,580
Dog!

957
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:35,290
You didn't expect me to be
here with Ram, right Prabha?

958
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:37,830
No, nothing like that.

959
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:40,500
Don't be apologetic.

960
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:41,580
It's okay.

961
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:44,540
I'm used to this,
since maybe ten years.

962
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,080
I'm over all that silly stuff.

963
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,290
We are just business partners.

964
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:51,290
This marriage is just a...

965
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:53,580
... working arrangement.

966
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:57,290
This nuptial chain...
is only for people.

967
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,080
-Cut this, Pawan.
-Okay, Madam.

968
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:02,620
About our business...

969
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:04,370
You know,

970
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:06,080
we are in dire straits.

971
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,330
I'm... desperate.

972
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:09,660
Prabha...

973
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,120
You don't have to explain to me.

974
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,540
He is a complete womanizer.

975
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,910
And... that's the only
way to get to him.

976
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:20,910
This thing called guilt...
If you remove that from your mind,

977
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:23,040
life becomes extremely smooth.

978
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,700
After all, it's a man-made thing.

979
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:27,620
Or is it woman-made?

980
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:30,830
Do you need any help here?

981
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:32,410
No, no.
Just help yourself.

982
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:34,910
Life in here... is a buffet.

983
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:36,580
Here!

984
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:44,250
So that's me...

985
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,700
investing 3 Crores...

986
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,080
... to Brahmand.

987
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,910
It will be renamed to 'Bram' Solutions.

988
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:51,290
Okay.

989
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,370
And here... is Prabha Nair,

990
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:55,080
the C-E-O.

991
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:57,370
And regarding the reporting system,

992
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:58,620
I'll come to that later.

993
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:00,410
Okay.

994
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:02,870
First of all, you need
a complete makeover.

995
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,950
You have to look sexy
and stylish, you know?

996
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:07,120
-Oh!
-Get rid of this Sari...

997
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:08,870
and try western outfits.

998
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:11,120
You have a lovely complexion.

999
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,580
-You'd look superb.
-Thank you.

1000
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:13,790
I'll take you out shopping.

1001
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:17,540
The first thing you should do...
is to get a residence Visa in the UAE.

1002
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,700
I'll get that done...
and you can stay with us.

1003
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:21,330
-Okay.
-And...

1004
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:24,250
you should open a bank account at
the Hinduja or Lombard over there.

1005
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:26,910
I'll be transferring the money
from my Swiss bank account...

1006
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:28,040
to this new account of yours.

1007
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:29,910
Don't worry about anything.

1008
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,000
I'll take care of all the nitty-gritties.

1009
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,660
-Yeah?
-Oh! Thank you!

1010
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:35,790
Good!

1011
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,700
Which one did you
like among these?

1012
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,910
These two are nice.

1013
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:15,950
Forget this one.

1014
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,620
Ram has already booked this one.

1015
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:18,870
You can take this one.

1016
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:27,000
-How's this?
-Arabic attire?

1017
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,370
-This is great.
-Do you want it?

1018
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:30,160
-No, I don't want it.
-Still...

1019
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,870
-Wear it once for me.
-No, dude.

1020
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,200
-Wear it.
-No, dude!

1021
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:35,250
You wear it!

1022
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:43,120
Shouldn't you be very careful while
selling your property, Basheer?

1023
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,370
And it's a property that has been around
since the time of the great Marakkar.

1024
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:52,080
Even if you want to buy a similar house
and property at such a prime location,

1025
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,410
can you manage it now?

1026
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:58,830
Only God knows how the times
are going to change, hereafter.

1027
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,040
Are you upset that this
property is being sold..,

1028
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,080
...or the fact that I am
selling it to Hindus?

1029
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:05,500
Why are you feigning ignorance, Ikka?

1030
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:07,500
Are you not aware of
what's happening around us?

1031
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,450
The problem is precisely that
you're selling it to the Kafirs.

1032
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:11,250
I'll tell you something.

1033
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:12,750
I came along with the Musaliyar,

1034
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:15,750
after finding a buyer from our faith
for your property.

1035
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,500
Two businessmen from
Manjeri are ready.

1036
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:20,120
They will pay
good money too.

1037
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,160
Money is not my only
consideration, Rahman.

1038
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:23,700
What else is your consideration?

1039
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:25,910
Musaliyar...

1040
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,370
This Nair and Menon
are like blood brothers to me.

1041
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,290
When they are asking me
something out of sheer need,

1042
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:36,450
it would be unfair on my part to
refuse them on grounds of religion..,

1043
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,080
...and sell it to someone of our faith.

1044
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:40,910
I won't do that.

1045
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:42,700
That does not befit
men of honour like us.

1046
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:44,870
You don't have to
lecture us about honour.

1047
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,250
Don't you know that they have
killed thousands of our brothers?

1048
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:50,910
Or... are you acting like
you're unaware of it?

1049
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,950
We should preserve at
least the land we own.

1050
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:59,330
Otherwise, they will turn us into
outsiders in our own land, soon enough.

1051
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:01,620
Rahman!
That's enough! Stop it.

1052
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:06,250
I'm not giving you a befitting reply,
just because you're at my house.

1053
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:08,410
How old are you, boy?

1054
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:09,750
Tell me.

1055
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:13,450
I know this land and the people here,
much more than you do.

1056
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:15,700
You don't have to
teach me all that.

1057
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,370
Musaliyar, please explain all this to him,
when you have the time.

1058
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:24,450
It is such hateful thinking that
creates big problems.

1059
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,790
Only if the people help each
other to grow and reform,

1060
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:31,540
will this land stay alive!

1061
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:35,580
Learn to love this country and
obey the law of this land, first.

1062
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,080
Everything else will
become alright on its own.

1063
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,370
No wonder you don't have a
prayer bump on your forehead.

1064
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:42,870
Prayer bump, huh?

1065
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,410
There are Muslims here,
who pray five times a day,

1066
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,700
and still don't
have a prayer bump.

1067
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:49,250
It's just that you
haven't seen such people.

1068
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:50,290
So don't tell me that.

1069
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:53,330
Musaliyar... you don't have to worry.

1070
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:55,750
I'm not selling the entire property.

1071
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:58,950
Just those four acres by the beach.

1072
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:02,200
The rest of the property and
this house will still be with me.

1073
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:06,870
Now, don't be upset.
Drink the juice, lad!

1074
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:10,160
Mom, look at Potty!
How does he look?

1075
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:14,040
Abdu, don't make him play
the fool. Take it off!

1076
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,290
Why? He looks really good!

1077
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:18,040
"Sheikh Potty Bin Melshanthi"!

1078
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,290
Sahib...

1079
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:22,330
The High Priest is here.

1080
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:24,790
-Is it time to take him back home?
-Yes.

1081
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:26,080
Abdu!

1082
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:28,500
Potty's father is
here to take him back.

1083
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:29,660
Bring him here.

1084
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,450
Come on, Sheikh Potty.

1085
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:32,750
Hey! Hey!

1086
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:34,200
Behave yourself!

1087
00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:36,120
Why are you standing
there, Potty? Have a seat.

1088
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,080
Dad, look at him!

1089
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,290
Sheikh Potty.

1090
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:49,660
What the hell are you doing, Abdu?

1091
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,080
Don't you dare play mischief
with anything and anyone.

1092
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,620
Go inside and take it off, son.

1093
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:55,120
Go.

1094
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,370
Please don't mind it, Priest.

1095
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:01,290
You know my son, right?

1096
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:02,410
Please don't bother.

1097
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:04,200
They are children,
it's natural.

1098
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:18,000
I don't send you here so that you can
dress up like a fool and humiliate me!

1099
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,790
That boy can't write
notes by himself or what?

1100
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:24,370
Should you go over
and help him everyday?

1101
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:27,370
They are uncivilized people.
Don't forget that.

1102
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:29,250
Show me your hand.

1103
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:32,950
Don't eat whatever
they give you.

1104
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:35,250
What is this?

1105
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,580
This is a dress
that Abdu gave me.

1106
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:40,540
Come on, walk!
Ass!

1107
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,040
Come on!

1108
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:46,620
Potty!

1109
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:48,000
You just want to stand here?
Come!

1110
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,450
I'll show you a great state-of-the-art
home theatre. Come on!

1111
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:51,830
Come, dude!

1112
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,750
Prabha! Hey!

1113
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,120
Look!

1114
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:04,620
It's an 8K projection.

1115
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,200
You can watch movies, TV channels...

1116
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:09,410
Moreover, you can even watch
porn in a theatre effect.

1117
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,200
Come, I'll show you.

1118
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:18,500
Sit down, man!

1119
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,200
What do you want to watch?

1120
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:21,540
Horror?

1121
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:22,660
Comedy?

1122
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:23,700
Action?

1123
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:24,750
Or....?

1124
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:28,370
Let's start.

1125
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:31,410
Hey Potty!

1126
01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:33,870
Your favourite actor
is still Rajinikanth, right?

1127
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:36,540
Come on.

1128
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:39,370
Annamalai is not available.

1129
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:41,500
I can't find Baasha.

1130
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:43,290
'Muthu'.
Is 'Muthu' okay?

1131
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:44,750
Yes, 'Muthu' is fine.
Play it.

1132
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,370
-Go forward.
-Huh?

1133
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:48,700
Fast forward!

1134
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,540
Some more.

1135
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:53,250
Some more.

1136
01:01:55,830 --> 01:01:56,870
Yes, stop here.

1137
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:58,250
Play it.

1138
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:07,700
Pause!

1139
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:08,750
Pause, pause!

1140
01:02:11,410 --> 01:02:14,910
Raghuvaran usurped the father Rajinikanth's
properties, using forged documents.

1141
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:17,410
The son Rajinikanth was a child then.

1142
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,290
But Raghuvaran is up for a shock.

1143
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:22,830
The father Rajinikanth
will forgive Raghuvaran.

1144
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,620
Out of that depression,

1145
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:25,950
Raghuvaran will commit suicide.

1146
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:29,330
A similar story has happened right here,
in this property too.

1147
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,620
But the one who committed suicide,
was not the betrayer.

1148
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,450
It was the betrayed.

1149
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:40,500
That Abdullah?

1150
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:41,750
Where is he now?

1151
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:43,250
Who knows!

1152
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:45,200
He fled from this
town long ago, right?

1153
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:48,080
What about his sisters?

1154
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:51,000
I saw it on a school WhatsApp
group which I was part of, earlier.

1155
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:52,830
That the two of them are
somewhere in Syria, apparently.

1156
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:55,540
But only God knows
who they are with,

1157
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:57,750
and what condition they are in.

1158
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,370
That country is going through
a revolt and war, right?

1159
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:02,790
Well, you should be knowing
about all this first.

1160
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:07,830
You can see news
channels also on this.

1161
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,080
Where's Mythili?

1162
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:12,700
Let me go downstairs.

1163
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,250
You're spoiling it.
Idiot!

1164
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:18,250
There are several reports about the
increasing crime rates in this city, sir.

1165
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:19,870
Is it because of the
indifference of the police?

1166
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:21,580
What do you have
to say about this?

1167
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:22,910
Ever since I took charge here,

1168
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:24,660
law and order issues have
dropped considerably.

1169
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,040
I can show you the statistics.

1170
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,080
Isn't this our Kalyanam?

1171
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,700
Hey! Don't call him that.

1172
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:30,870
Kalyan!
That's his name.

1173
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:32,660
Wait.

1174
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,700
I was going to give you a surprise.

1175
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:42,200
He is the proxy fund manager
of Accadio Saket in Kerala.

1176
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:43,790
Women's safety, child safety...

1177
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:46,910
Police have undertaken large scale
surveillance measures in these fronts.

1178
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:48,450
He's a silent partner
of all this too.

1179
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:50,500
-He's a DIG in the police.
-I've heard that.

1180
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,500
And the surprise is that...

1181
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:56,620
...he is coming here.

1182
01:03:56,830 --> 01:03:57,830
In some time.

1183
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:01,330
It's good to have a police
connection in your business too.

1184
01:04:01,790 --> 01:04:03,000
You talk to him.

1185
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:04,950
You can stay here
and leave tomorrow.

1186
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:07,160
After dinner,

1187
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,200
I need to have some deep
discussions with Prabha.

1188
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:12,120
Even if I go back to Southampton,
Prabha will have to come there.

1189
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,660
I'll be signing the
papers over there.

1190
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:17,660
Hey Potty!

1191
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,910
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

1192
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:21,330
You got me, right?

1193
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:29,250
-What?
-Sir, a man is here.

1194
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:30,290
Who?

1195
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:31,950
Who are you?
Sir wants to know.

1196
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:33,830
Sir, he's saying that
he's your friend.

1197
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,330
Hey! Kalyan Menon is here.

1198
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:36,450
Send him in.

1199
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:37,660
Okay.
You may go inside.

1200
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,500
Hey Kalyan!

1201
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:43,910
Where is my friend?

1202
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:45,540
He went to the backside, sir.

1203
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:46,870
Backside?
Why?

1204
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:48,790
How do I know, sir?

1205
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:50,330
Come, let's go and check.

1206
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:52,370
Kalyan!

1207
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,160
Who is this?

1208
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:04,910
Who is this?

1209
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Father!

1210
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,160
Yes!

1211
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:17,370
What is it, son?

1212
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,250
Are you fine, father?

1213
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,040
Of course!

1214
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:23,790
We lost everything!

1215
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:26,950
And yet you are fine?

1216
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:34,790
That's right, father.

1217
01:05:40,790 --> 01:05:42,290
Heard what my father said?

1218
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:46,370
"So what if we lost the house, son...

1219
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:50,540
They have built us a
Jannat-Ul-Firdaus here!"

1220
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,330
Abdullah Marakkar.

1221
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:54,950
How did he reach here?

1222
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,950
The house that Ram built...

1223
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:03,290
... is just like you
building a house for me.

1224
01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:04,950
Abdu...

1225
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:17,080
We lost everything, son.

1226
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:19,620
Everything!

1227
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,290
We lost your father too!

1228
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:37,290
Abdu...

1229
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,200
Mother!

1230
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,910
Aishu had called
me over the phone.

1231
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:48,200
She told me that...

1232
01:06:48,410 --> 01:06:51,040
she will be going to the city,

1233
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,500
with her husband.

1234
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:54,910
We need to find where they are.

1235
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:58,500
We need to find who took her.

1236
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,750
Promise me, son.

1237
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:04,120
Promise your mother.

1238
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:07,120
The promise of a madman...

1239
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,330
What value does it have, mother?

1240
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:20,500
Mother!

1241
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:40,250
Two women among the 174 people who
died in the bomb attack at Syria...

1242
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:42,410
I heard that they were
Beevuamma's daughters.

1243
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,290
We didn't tell her that
because she was ailing.

1244
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:54,370
Aisha!

1245
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:56,750
Rehana!

1246
01:07:57,870 --> 01:07:59,080
Aisha!

1247
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:01,790
Rehana!

1248
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,290
Brother...

1249
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:17,950
Save us from here, brother!

1250
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:23,000
Save us, brother!

1251
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:26,080
Brother...

1252
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:28,000
Brother!

1253
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:33,910
Here stood almost 500 years ago,

1254
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:37,200
an original structure
built by successors...

1255
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,660
... of the great Naval captain of Kerala,

1256
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:40,910
Kunjali, the Third,

1257
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:43,370
also known as Kunjali Marakkar.

1258
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:55,660
Hey Potty!

1259
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:57,540
Your Holiness,
do you want to bowl?

1260
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:59,290
Go and be the Umpire,
you ass!

1261
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,500
I will bowl...!

1262
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:03,080
Pace! Pace!

1263
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:05,700
Malcolm Marshall..!!
You are finished, Abdullah!

1264
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:14,830
When you destroy something,

1265
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:18,410
you should destroy it completely.

1266
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:34,870
-Ramakumara!
-Abdu, no!

1267
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,080
-Hey!

1268
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:42,750
Louder!

1269
01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:46,830
You should scream
a little louder!

1270
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,410
No one will hear it even then.

1271
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:53,620
Though he's rich and famous now,

1272
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:54,870
Abdu, please.

1273
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:59,540
there's no sign of a human here
to respond to a scream here.

1274
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:05,330
So, if this Abdu decides to take revenge
for everything that happened in the past,

1275
01:11:06,790 --> 01:11:09,910
there's no one here to say
it to the outside world.

1276
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:11,450
Right?

1277
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:15,450
Will you say it?

1278
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,450
Abdu, no!
Let go of him.

1279
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:21,540
Abdu, please.

1280
01:11:22,910 --> 01:11:24,830
The way you've caught me now...

1281
01:11:25,450 --> 01:11:27,080
Is it for me to kill him...

1282
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,540
or not to kill him?
-To kill him. I mean, not to kill him.

1283
01:11:29,950 --> 01:11:31,250
Abdu, please.

1284
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:32,790
Got scared?

1285
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
"Your Holiness!"

1286
01:11:34,410 --> 01:11:35,450
I was kidding!

1287
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:36,700
It's just a show.

1288
01:11:36,950 --> 01:11:38,450
But you....!!

1289
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:41,910
You should be scared.

1290
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:45,580
Because this is Abdu's night.

1291
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:49,200
Do you have a doubt?

1292
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:56,910
Look!

1293
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:02,870
Sir! Don't look at the moon today.

1294
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:04,620
It's the Ganesh Chathurthi festival today.

1295
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:05,660
You will be cursed.

1296
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:09,120
Who are you, you little devil?

1297
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:10,620
Bhede.

1298
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,250
Pawanputra Bhede.

1299
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:15,080
Pawanputra Bhede?

1300
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:18,370
Come on!

1301
01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:21,370
Let's talk!

1302
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:29,910
I've kept everything ready, Madam.

1303
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,910
This is Pulao, this is Paratha...

1304
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:33,700
This is Aloo Gobi and
this is Matar Paneer.

1305
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:35,250
-Okay.
-Call me if there's anything.

1306
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:38,370
Is it okay if I stay over tonight
with my uncle and friends,

1307
01:12:38,410 --> 01:12:40,080
and come back tomorrow
afternoon, Madam?

1308
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,410
Hail Lord Ram!

1309
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:42,580
Hail Lord Ram!

1310
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:45,330
Mythili...

1311
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,790
Why is he dressed like this?

1312
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,750
He's a member of Kothadia's party.

1313
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:50,660
Let him go.
That's better.

1314
01:12:58,410 --> 01:12:59,870
Sir, I'm talking about the rules.

1315
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:04,910
I gave them
permission because...

1316
01:13:04,910 --> 01:13:08,160
...they had promised that not one
person more than thousand people...

1317
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,290
...will be there at the grounds
to listen to his speech.

1318
01:13:10,290 --> 01:13:12,660
But sir, I had already informed you, right?

1319
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:15,290
Sir, more than 400 of his supporters
from different states...

1320
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:19,120
...have been staying in different
hotels here for the past one week.

1321
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,370
How many people are
attending this meeting?

1322
01:13:20,450 --> 01:13:21,750
Already 2000 plus, sir.

1323
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:23,330
There's full media coverage too.

1324
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:25,620
Almost all the COVID protocols
have been flouted, sir.

1325
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:27,250
In that case, you should
have taken a call.

1326
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:28,700
You're the Commissioner
of this city, right?

1327
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:29,910
Who is in charge there now?

1328
01:13:29,950 --> 01:13:31,580
2 ACP's, 4 CI's....

1329
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:34,540
and almost more than a hundred
constables are there at the spot, sir.

1330
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:35,790
In that case,

1331
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:38,750
we have to think of
something more effective.

1332
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:41,450
Revel among relics,
live in history.

1333
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:43,790
This is good.

1334
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:47,250
It's good to have the company of at
least one thief who's bigger than you.

1335
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:51,540
Oh! Wow!

1336
01:13:52,290 --> 01:13:54,040
-Did you call?
-Yes. The cops will come now.

1337
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:02,370
Saddam Hussein's
favourite brand of wine.

1338
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:03,700
Woah!

1339
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:07,330
I must try this drink, Ram!

1340
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:14,910
Yuck!

1341
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:17,080
Stale black tea!

1342
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,660
So everything here is fake, right?

1343
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:27,910
Deception during betrayal..!

1344
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:30,660
Catch it!

1345
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Oh no!

1346
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,200
You're impressive, Ram!

1347
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:39,750
You've kept your old cunningness intact.

1348
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:48,120
Bloody shit!

1349
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,330
Accadio Sanctum.

1350
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:54,500
Accadio believes in
preserving origins.

1351
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:57,370
Hey! It's just an extension. Let's
go there and talk peacefully.

1352
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:58,660
"Awake!

1353
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:01,540
For morning in the bowl of night...

1354
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:05,250
...has flung the stone that
puts the stars to flight."

1355
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:06,330
Abdu, no!

1356
01:15:06,330 --> 01:15:09,330
"And lo, the hunter of
the east has caught..."

1357
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:31,250
,

1358
01:16:35,950 --> 01:16:39,790
After destroying history, under the
false pretence of preserving history,

1359
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:43,330
after taking a foundation brick from
the remains of that destroyed history,

1360
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:47,250
after placing that stone in a
prayer room covered in green,

1361
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:49,830
and after posting a pseudo
historic caption below it,

1362
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,040
you invite the students of
history from lands afar,

1363
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,370
...hoodwink them, rob them of their
precious money...

1364
01:16:55,370 --> 01:16:57,080
...to lead this
luxurious life of yours!

1365
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:01,750
Hats off....

1366
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:03,290
Ram!

1367
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:07,500
When I see all this,
as a bosom friend of yours,

1368
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:09,450
I can ideally react...
in two ways:

1369
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:10,750
Either,

1370
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:13,330
be proud of the fact that
you are still nurturing

1371
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:15,950
your old ancestral skill of
living off betraying others,

1372
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:18,450
be proud that it still has been a
profitable proposition for you,

1373
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:21,500
and be proud that you have
become a great success in life.

1374
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:24,790
I can gatecrash here, celebrate
your success with a drink or two,

1375
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:29,290
be happy for you and go back to my world.

1376
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:36,250
Or I can be shocked and
jealous seeing all this glitter,

1377
01:17:36,870 --> 01:17:38,500
drink your booze,
enjoy your hospitality,

1378
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:40,700
and puke it out before
I go back to my world.

1379
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:42,910
But this beautiful night....

1380
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:45,250
...is expecting neither from me.

1381
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:51,040
For, the real owner of
all that you see here...

1382
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:53,200
...happens to be me!

1383
01:17:59,330 --> 01:18:01,200
In your father's betrayal,

1384
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,160
in this empire that you've built,

1385
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:09,160
in this property where
we're sitting now,

1386
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:14,620
had fallen the tears of my family, my
mother and my sisters, and you know that.

1387
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:18,790
You also know that this has been
built upon my father's blood.

1388
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:23,040
If someone is well aware
of the crime he has committed,

1389
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:26,450
and still continues to live his life,

1390
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:28,450
enjoying all the privileges
that came with it,

1391
01:18:28,450 --> 01:18:30,450
without feeling even
an iota of remorse,

1392
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:34,750
then a Judgement becomes inevitable,
because justice has to be served.

1393
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,500
A verdict!

1394
01:18:39,450 --> 01:18:41,000
That one double-edged word,

1395
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,120
which resides within
both 'justice'...

1396
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,700
...and 'revenge'.

1397
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:47,540
'Theerppu'.

1398
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:53,620
Till now, I had wished only to
give a tight slap across your face,

1399
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:55,750
if I ever ran into you.

1400
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:57,620
But... not anymore.

1401
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:03,370
Your husband's history of betrayal...

1402
01:19:03,950 --> 01:19:05,290
... has just begun unravelling.

1403
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:09,410
The three of you are the jury here.

1404
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,450
I am Abdullah Marakkar...

1405
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:17,790
The Supreme Judge, here.

1406
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
What's your name?

1407
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:24,660
Mythili.

1408
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:27,500
Wow! Everything is perfect!

1409
01:19:30,450 --> 01:19:31,540
Go ahead!

1410
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:33,790
Narrate the rest of the story yourself.

1411
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:37,000
The Advocate read the
agreement aloud for my father.

1412
01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:39,830
What was it?

1413
01:19:40,290 --> 01:19:42,660
That we'll take only the
beachfront and the adjacent 4 acres,

1414
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:43,700
and that we won't touch the rest.

1415
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:49,870
This story of this treachery by
your king and his daddy,

1416
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:52,500
can't be confined to a
single movie, my dear.

1417
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:56,330
It's as vast as, say, a "Game of Thrones".

1418
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:00,080
Tell us the next scene, Ram.

1419
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:04,750
Say it, man!

1420
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,040
Mr. Menon...

1421
01:20:08,330 --> 01:20:09,330
Mr. Nair...

1422
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:13,080
We need that ancient house along
with the beachfront property.

1423
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:16,580
Not just the beachfront property.
They're asking for the house too.

1424
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:19,080
She'll cancel the deal if she
doesn't get the entire property.

1425
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,870
Else, we just drop
this deal altogether.

1426
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:23,330
Or else, she'll drop this deal.

1427
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,410
-What?
-Just come with me.

1428
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:28,870
Just a minute.
I'll be right back.

1429
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,120
Please wait.

1430
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:32,910
Hey! Look!

1431
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,080
What is it?

1432
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:36,500
Look at her hair, dude.

1433
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:38,000
It's really nice, right?

1434
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:42,250
What?

1435
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:43,750
Is this really necessary?

1436
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:50,080
When the tile company ran into
losses and I was in debt of millions,

1437
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:52,040
I had begged your landlord
dad to help me out.

1438
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:54,080
He didn't give me
a single penny.

1439
01:20:54,410 --> 01:20:55,410
So, you better shut up!

1440
01:20:58,450 --> 01:21:00,000
Menon, please come.

1441
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:01,700
What is it, Nair?

1442
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:07,700
Now stop gawking and study!

1443
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:10,540
-What is it?
-Come with me.

1444
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:15,160
What should we tell her now?

1445
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,290
If we agree to this,

1446
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:18,830
it should profit us too, right?

1447
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:20,040
That, she will ensure.

1448
01:21:20,330 --> 01:21:21,870
-She must!
-How?

1449
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,910
A foreign company cannot come to India...

1450
01:21:25,370 --> 01:21:27,700
... and start something
on its own, as of now.

1451
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:31,040
They have to buy land in the
name of an Indian citizen first,

1452
01:21:31,410 --> 01:21:33,750
and then, he has to
lease it to the company.

1453
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:36,700
Or else, we must make these
foreigners our overseas partners,

1454
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:38,950
for the trade that we're conducting here.

1455
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,080
It will work out, right?

1456
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:41,700
There won't be any
problem, right?

1457
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:45,540
If you ask me so... what we're going
to do, is completely problematic!

1458
01:21:46,330 --> 01:21:48,250
So, first you decide...

1459
01:21:48,290 --> 01:21:49,620
whether we have to do it or not.

1460
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:50,950
Let me know after that.

1461
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:52,160
I didn't mean that.

1462
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,370
I... err...

1463
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:55,000
You go ahead.
I'm listening.

1464
01:21:57,370 --> 01:21:58,370
Are you sure?

1465
01:21:58,700 --> 01:21:59,660
I am sure.

1466
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:01,160
Then I'll tell you
one more fact.

1467
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:03,700
If people without a conscience,

1468
01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:05,700
start acting as if they
have a conscience,

1469
01:22:05,790 --> 01:22:07,540
it will not only be
difficult for them,

1470
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:09,750
but also for the others who
are trying to help them out.

1471
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:13,580
So... stop this 'acting', first.

1472
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:15,830
This is your only opportunity.

1473
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:18,000
We're giving Lakhs
to Basheerkka, right?

1474
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:19,410
And not for free, right?

1475
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:22,450
I'll make the
necessary corrections...

1476
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:24,790
...in the agreement that
we read out to him.

1477
01:22:24,830 --> 01:22:25,830
Leave that to me.

1478
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:29,160
Get the property registered
in your name first.

1479
01:22:30,290 --> 01:22:32,040
You don't have to be
so guilty about it.

1480
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,120
What about you then?

1481
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:34,450
Your share?

1482
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:36,410
After we sign the
deal with them,

1483
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:40,080
I'll draft another agreement, which
will be between the two of us.

1484
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:42,830
Since the moral risk in
this case is totally yours,

1485
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:45,700
from the profit we
make from this deal,

1486
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,580
80% will be yours.

1487
01:22:48,290 --> 01:22:49,330
20% will be mine.

1488
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:56,830
We need to ask one more thing.

1489
01:22:57,620 --> 01:23:02,910
After your death, your son needs to have
a hold over the company and the profit.

1490
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,200
Also, the profit sharing
between Ram and Kalyan,

1491
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:07,580
shall continue to be
on the same terms.

1492
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,160
Okay?

1493
01:23:13,790 --> 01:23:14,790
We are ready.

1494
01:23:14,830 --> 01:23:16,660
But there are certain conditions.

1495
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,160
Okay!

1496
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,700
Book Cricket
Ramkumar - 4, Abdullah - 2

1497
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:39,160
Sahib, the agreeement was
read out to you, right?

1498
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:41,450
-Yes.
-You want to read it once again?

1499
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:43,200
No.

1500
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:44,790
The advocate had read it out to me.

1501
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:50,910
You can sign here.

1502
01:23:51,870 --> 01:23:53,370
I don't know how to sign.

1503
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:55,830
Do you have a stamp pad?

1504
01:23:56,450 --> 01:23:57,790
Get him the stamp pad.

1505
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:03,580
-Where?
-Over here.

1506
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:07,620
Yes!

1507
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Six!

1508
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:16,160
Come on, continue.

1509
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:24,330
Your turn.

1510
01:24:31,370 --> 01:24:32,370
Hey Nair!

1511
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:38,120
Don't tell him that I'm here.

1512
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:44,620
Are you studying?

1513
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:46,700
-No. We're playing the game of dots.
-Carry on!

1514
01:24:47,450 --> 01:24:48,450
Nair!

1515
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:50,790
Hey Nair!

1516
01:24:58,750 --> 01:24:59,790
Sahib....

1517
01:25:00,450 --> 01:25:04,120
That white lady's people are
asking me to vacate my house.

1518
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:07,700
Did you add our home too
to the sale deed?

1519
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:08,950
Sahib, let us sit
inside and talk.

1520
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:10,330
Just give me a yes or no.

1521
01:25:10,410 --> 01:25:12,950
Did you add my home too,
when you wrote the sale deed?

1522
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,120
Oh no, Sahib!

1523
01:25:14,410 --> 01:25:16,330
I didn't write the agreements, right?

1524
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,250
It was the foreign
company people, right?

1525
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:21,450
Didn't I ask you to sign it only after
hearing what's written in the agreement?

1526
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:23,620
Since you can't read,

1527
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:26,410
Advocate Menon had read
it out for you, right?

1528
01:25:32,290 --> 01:25:33,290
He is inside, right?

1529
01:25:35,450 --> 01:25:36,500
Yes.

1530
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:37,830
Didn't I read out everything?

1531
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,950
It was an agreement to
sell the whole property.

1532
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:42,290
In the agreement you read
out to me, it was specifically stated

1533
01:25:42,330 --> 01:25:43,830
that they will take only
the beachfront area,

1534
01:25:43,870 --> 01:25:45,450
and won't touch my house
and surroundings. Wasn't it so?

1535
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:48,040
No. That's not what
we said or read out.

1536
01:25:48,330 --> 01:25:50,000
Even if that was the case,
you stand to lose nothing.

1537
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:53,290
You're getting eight lakhs for the
whole property including the house.

1538
01:25:53,330 --> 01:25:54,660
Isn't that a huge amount?

1539
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:57,870
You can repay all your debts,
well, to an extent, with that.

1540
01:25:58,370 --> 01:25:59,370
If not anything else,

1541
01:25:59,450 --> 01:26:02,450
you can at least meet your own
medical expenses properly, right?

1542
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,290
Longevity is more important
than anything else, right?

1543
01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:08,910
I haven't come to talk
about the money, Nair.

1544
01:26:10,450 --> 01:26:13,950
The two of you made me sell
off my house as well, huh?

1545
01:26:13,950 --> 01:26:17,580
That house has played host even to the
Prophet's disciples. Do you know that?

1546
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:19,370
Leave alone quoting a price for it,

1547
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:22,540
I can't even imagine selling it.

1548
01:26:23,330 --> 01:26:24,700
Not just me.

1549
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,330
No one can do that.

1550
01:26:26,910 --> 01:26:29,040
Even if you think about doing that,

1551
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:32,580
God will not forgive you.

1552
01:26:33,910 --> 01:26:35,250
Let go of him, Basheerkka.

1553
01:27:04,450 --> 01:27:07,200
There's no point in manhandling us
after signing the documents.

1554
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:14,120
Without spite or hatred in one's mind,

1555
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,910
if one forgives the sinners,

1556
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:20,080
it is supposed to be equal to
offering a thousand prayers.

1557
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:33,870
But... for what you
have done here now,

1558
01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:35,750
sooner or later,

1559
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:38,580
you will have to face retribution.
A 'Theerppu'!

1560
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:43,660
But it won't be from me.

1561
01:27:44,290 --> 01:27:45,290
It will be from Allah!

1562
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,040
What's your problem now?

1563
01:28:06,830 --> 01:28:08,080
Whatever I am doing is legal.

1564
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,200
Legal?

1565
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:13,250
Sooner or later, you, me and our son
Ram, will have to suffer for this.

1566
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:14,410
Wait and watch!

1567
01:28:14,450 --> 01:28:16,250
He cursed you from the
bottom of his heart.

1568
01:28:17,790 --> 01:28:20,200
At least go, fall at his feet and
seek his forgiveness!

1569
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:30,540
Children shouldn't be around
when elders are talking.

1570
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Go inside, son.

1571
01:28:39,660 --> 01:28:40,660
Priest..,

1572
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:45,950
This country existed for so long...

1573
01:28:46,450 --> 01:28:48,830
... only because of a mutual understanding.

1574
01:28:49,370 --> 01:28:50,370
Right?

1575
01:28:54,330 --> 01:28:59,160
When my Uncle from the Arabia said
that I should be sent to a school,

1576
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:01,870
my father told my uncle,
"He has this field"

1577
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:04,450
"This farm"

1578
01:29:05,410 --> 01:29:07,290
"We just have to save money"

1579
01:29:07,950 --> 01:29:09,250
"This country is a good place"

1580
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:15,000
"This country and its people...

1581
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:17,120
... will never create any trouble"

1582
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,410
"We can hire people to
read and write for us"

1583
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:25,700
"You just have to be
able to afford it"

1584
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,540
It was my father's last word.

1585
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:31,500
An old Hajiyar's verdict.

1586
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:39,410
You can call it arrogance too.

1587
01:29:41,870 --> 01:29:44,200
My father trusted
this country so much!

1588
01:29:47,620 --> 01:29:52,080
Though the tears of my entire
family has fallen on this land today,

1589
01:29:54,410 --> 01:29:55,830
I understood a fact.

1590
01:29:57,620 --> 01:29:59,290
That you people are not my friends...

1591
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:04,660
... and you can never be, either.

1592
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:08,000
Never!

1593
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:20,450
I've always considered you
like my own brother, Nair.

1594
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:22,750
And yet, you did this to us?

1595
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:25,910
Where will we go with
these three children?

1596
01:30:26,950 --> 01:30:28,620
Beewathu...

1597
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:29,700
You go inside.

1598
01:30:30,450 --> 01:30:32,450
Women don't have
to come out and assert.

1599
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:33,790
Got it?

1600
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:46,950
How many days do I
have left, to vacate?

1601
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:48,950
They have to start
work within two days.

1602
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:50,910
But you can take a week, Ikka.

1603
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:52,620
To pack all this, you'll need...

1604
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:55,410
I'll handle all that.

1605
01:30:56,330 --> 01:30:57,500
You both may leave now.

1606
01:31:00,370 --> 01:31:01,410
I will shift from here.

1607
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:03,500
I will shift within two days.

1608
01:31:05,950 --> 01:31:06,950
Well...

1609
01:31:07,410 --> 01:31:08,910
Aren't you taking your children along?

1610
01:31:09,620 --> 01:31:10,620
Forgot that too?

1611
01:31:11,830 --> 01:31:14,700
Aren't you doing all
this for their sake?

1612
01:31:16,330 --> 01:31:17,330
Abdu!

1613
01:31:17,330 --> 01:31:18,790
Send your friends out.

1614
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:20,830
Abdu, my book?

1615
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Sahib...

1616
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:29,870
One share of the profit we
make from this business,

1617
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:31,160
will be yours....

1618
01:31:33,410 --> 01:31:34,410
Allah!

1619
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:38,370
Do I have to hear that too, Nair?

1620
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:43,540
My footwear...

1621
01:31:46,950 --> 01:31:49,160
I was furious at my father, that day.

1622
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:52,250
"What you did was a grave sin, Dad"

1623
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:54,790
"It's an unforgivable sin"...
I said all that.

1624
01:31:54,830 --> 01:31:58,870
That's Malcolm Marshall bowling and the
ball hits the bat and he's gone! He's gone!

1625
01:31:58,910 --> 01:32:00,830
This will put an end
to Abdu's bragging!

1626
01:32:02,370 --> 01:32:03,700
Come here!

1627
01:32:05,410 --> 01:32:07,910
My dad slapped me on
my face that day.

1628
01:32:08,910 --> 01:32:11,120
That pain still
remains on this cheek.

1629
01:32:26,870 --> 01:32:27,870
Sorry to say this, sir.

1630
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:29,910
Sir is not at all co-operative.

1631
01:32:29,910 --> 01:32:30,950
What do you mean?

1632
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:32,040
Please, please.

1633
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,120
Now don't make this an ego
tussle between you two.

1634
01:33:09,830 --> 01:33:11,540
I do this all the time, right?

1635
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:13,540
Move away.

1636
01:33:14,290 --> 01:33:15,450
What's this new habit?

1637
01:33:19,540 --> 01:33:21,200
What's with this new habit?

1638
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:23,330
What are you doing?

1639
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:39,500
Have it, all of you.

1640
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:43,200
How's your father's Biriyani?

1641
01:33:43,830 --> 01:33:45,250
It's delicious, father!

1642
01:33:45,330 --> 01:33:47,290
Eat until your tummy is full, dear.

1643
01:33:52,790 --> 01:33:54,040
After paying off the debts,

1644
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:57,410
I have deposited the remaining
Rs. 2 Lakhs in the bank, in your name.

1645
01:33:57,750 --> 01:34:00,040
Here are the documents.

1646
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:01,040
In the bank?

1647
01:34:01,290 --> 01:34:02,290
In my name?

1648
01:34:02,370 --> 01:34:03,370
Yes!

1649
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:05,040
And...

1650
01:34:06,410 --> 01:34:08,000
I sold our car.

1651
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:09,580
For scrap price.

1652
01:34:09,870 --> 01:34:11,660
What's the point
in keeping it now?

1653
01:34:12,910 --> 01:34:14,290
Why are you saying all this now?

1654
01:34:14,790 --> 01:34:15,870
You will be with us, no?

1655
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:18,540
All of us...

1656
01:34:19,910 --> 01:34:22,080
... can shift to my
sister's house in Manjeri.

1657
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:25,830
Though it's not as spacious,

1658
01:34:25,950 --> 01:34:27,000
it's a good house.

1659
01:34:27,330 --> 01:34:28,620
She will have some company too.

1660
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:31,200
Eat, dear.

1661
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:32,700
Have your food, Abdu.

1662
01:34:44,370 --> 01:34:47,200
They know what
happened to my father.

1663
01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:13,410
Father!

1664
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,160
You left us, huh?

1665
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:19,080
You left us?

1666
01:35:19,330 --> 01:35:20,410
Father!

1667
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:21,450
Coward!

1668
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,160
Coward!

1669
01:35:23,790 --> 01:35:25,080
You left us?

1670
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:28,200
You left us behind?

1671
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:34,620
Father!

1672
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:38,160
Father!

1673
01:35:44,830 --> 01:35:46,580
Father!

1674
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:53,120
It's okay even if we
lose the land, Musaliyar.

1675
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:56,450
We should at least stop them
from demolishing the house.

1676
01:35:56,870 --> 01:35:58,040
For my husband!

1677
01:35:59,540 --> 01:36:01,080
He loved it more
than anything.

1678
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:03,450
Nothing is possible now, Beewathu.

1679
01:36:03,790 --> 01:36:04,910
There will be a huge ruckus.

1680
01:36:05,330 --> 01:36:07,660
They will riot all over town.

1681
01:36:07,950 --> 01:36:09,830
Nothing is possible now.
You may go.

1682
01:36:14,620 --> 01:36:15,660
Wait.

1683
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:18,120
There is one way.

1684
01:36:18,750 --> 01:36:20,250
When are they going to demolish it?

1685
01:36:20,330 --> 01:36:21,330
Immediately.

1686
01:36:22,330 --> 01:36:26,250
Achu's son Chandrabhanu is working at the
archaeological department in the town.

1687
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:28,160
Let's go and meet him.

1688
01:36:28,290 --> 01:36:31,200
We can find out if there are some
Government rules that may help us.

1689
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:33,290
Why do you have to take
so much effort, Musaliyar?

1690
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:34,830
We too have boys with us!

1691
01:36:34,910 --> 01:36:36,580
Let them start a riot.

1692
01:36:36,910 --> 01:36:38,160
We'll reply in the same coin.

1693
01:36:38,370 --> 01:36:39,370
Shut up, boy!

1694
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,200
Riots and fights may not always be
won by the side of truth.

1695
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:47,700
Even if a truthful minority
fights with the majority,

1696
01:36:47,790 --> 01:36:50,580
it's the majority that ends up
winning, most of the time.

1697
01:36:50,790 --> 01:36:51,790
You know that?

1698
01:36:51,790 --> 01:36:53,370
So shut up and go home!

1699
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:54,500
Get lost!

1700
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:11,160
Oh my God!

1701
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:13,950
This is 400 years old.

1702
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:19,200
If only a quarter of it
has been demolished so far,

1703
01:37:19,290 --> 01:37:20,870
we can stop the demolition,

1704
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:25,160
and find ways to make the Government
preserve the house, at least.

1705
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:28,660
You delayed it so far,
despite having this with you?

1706
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:32,750
You keep preventing your children from
going to schools and studying English,

1707
01:37:32,790 --> 01:37:35,700
and keep sending them
to your Madrasas.

1708
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:38,410
And finally your
documents and properties

1709
01:37:38,410 --> 01:37:40,620
will be usurped by people
who can read and write.

1710
01:37:41,410 --> 01:37:42,410
Someone come with me.

1711
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:43,660
No. Just one of you.

1712
01:37:43,950 --> 01:37:44,950
Abdu...

1713
01:37:45,450 --> 01:37:46,450
Go with him, son.

1714
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:47,750
Come, come!

1715
01:37:48,870 --> 01:37:50,200
-Son..
-Yes, mother.

1716
01:37:51,450 --> 01:37:52,910
You shouldn't get anxious.

1717
01:37:53,290 --> 01:37:54,580
Your mother has no one else.

1718
01:38:09,660 --> 01:38:10,660
Hey!

1719
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:13,330
That Archaeology officer is coming.

1720
01:38:13,370 --> 01:38:14,660
Detonate it. Quickly!

1721
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:15,750
Make it fast!

1722
01:38:15,870 --> 01:38:16,910
Hey! Stop it!

1723
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:18,080
Don't demolish it.

1724
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:19,790
This is illegal.

1725
01:38:19,790 --> 01:38:21,500
-Demolish it!
-Quick!

1726
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:22,950
Do it quickly!

1727
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:24,410
No!
Stop it.

1728
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:26,750
-Don't demolish it.
-What are you doing, Abdu?

1729
01:38:26,790 --> 01:38:28,870
Someone stop him.

1730
01:38:28,910 --> 01:38:30,750
Don't go there.

1731
01:38:30,750 --> 01:38:32,540
-Stop it.
-Abdu!

1732
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:34,250
Stop him!

1733
01:38:34,290 --> 01:38:35,450
Abdu, stop.

1734
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:38,500
Abdu!

1735
01:38:40,410 --> 01:38:41,410
Abdu!

1736
01:38:41,830 --> 01:38:43,250
Son...

1737
01:38:45,580 --> 01:38:46,580
Abdu!

1738
01:38:46,910 --> 01:38:48,290
Hey Abdu!

1739
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,040
What does...

1740
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:00,500
... the Jury say?

1741
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:05,160
What punishment
will bring justice?

1742
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:13,790
From this silence,
I should understand that...

1743
01:39:14,450 --> 01:39:19,250
the majority does not approve
of any kind of punishment.

1744
01:39:21,330 --> 01:39:22,330
Forget it.

1745
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:28,620
Does the Jury at least acknowledge the
fact that a crime was committed here?

1746
01:39:32,370 --> 01:39:33,370
Then...

1747
01:39:33,950 --> 01:39:35,870
against the majority,

1748
01:39:36,790 --> 01:39:39,080
and with conscience
as the only witness,

1749
01:39:39,410 --> 01:39:43,950
Abdullah Marakkar, the Supreme
Judge must proclaim the judgement.

1750
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:46,200
The final judgement.

1751
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:55,540
An ancient house which had
a history of centuries.

1752
01:39:56,540 --> 01:39:59,080
A house which was
demolished through treachery.

1753
01:40:00,250 --> 01:40:02,870
For orchestrating that demolition,

1754
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,910
and for conspiring towards it,

1755
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:07,540
for being the beneficiary
of that betrayal,

1756
01:40:07,580 --> 01:40:11,660
for gaining social and
financial stature through it,

1757
01:40:12,410 --> 01:40:14,540
for causing a death
due to that betrayal,

1758
01:40:14,620 --> 01:40:18,790
and for being responsible for a
family that was lost in the streets,

1759
01:40:19,370 --> 01:40:23,160
V. Ramkumar Nair, son of Vikraman Nair
has been sentenced by this Court,

1760
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:25,450
this Court of God,

1761
01:40:27,450 --> 01:40:29,250
...to death!

1762
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:31,000
Hey Abdu!
What is this?

1763
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:32,500
Sit down!

1764
01:40:33,870 --> 01:40:36,660
You should see certain
things before you are killed.

1765
01:40:39,330 --> 01:40:40,830
You should also experience...

1766
01:40:40,870 --> 01:40:43,500
...the trauma of losing everything
that you hold dear in life.

1767
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:46,000
The shock of seeing things getting
destroyed right in front of your eyes.

1768
01:40:47,450 --> 01:40:48,660
But...

1769
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:51,750
... your mother?

1770
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:53,450
She died ten years back.

1771
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:55,330
She suffered a lot.

1772
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:57,120
She had tuberculosis.

1773
01:40:59,870 --> 01:41:00,870
Ah!

1774
01:41:01,580 --> 01:41:03,000
Good people are
always like that.

1775
01:41:03,660 --> 01:41:05,330
They die only after
suffering a lot.

1776
01:41:05,660 --> 01:41:06,950
She liked you a lot.

1777
01:41:07,790 --> 01:41:09,250
She always used
to talk about you.

1778
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:15,910
But my dear Ram, dead people
are not going to know...

1779
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:18,370
... who died and who killed whom.

1780
01:41:19,410 --> 01:41:20,790
But you don't have to be scared.

1781
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:22,750
Since you're not a good man,

1782
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:25,080
you will never suffer
before you die.

1783
01:41:27,450 --> 01:41:29,040
Everything will be quick.

1784
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Well...

1785
01:41:32,410 --> 01:41:35,620
Should we not toss a coin
before the match begins, Potty?

1786
01:41:36,950 --> 01:41:39,700
How can we forget old
habits so easily?

1787
01:41:46,290 --> 01:41:47,290
Yes!

1788
01:41:51,830 --> 01:41:52,830
Hey!

1789
01:41:53,370 --> 01:41:54,870
Don't move!

1790
01:41:57,410 --> 01:41:59,120
-Call the police!
-They will come now.

1791
01:42:03,660 --> 01:42:04,660
Where is Kalyan?

1792
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:06,040
He's not answering.

1793
01:42:06,450 --> 01:42:11,330
Amitabh Bachchan's dialogue
from "Sholay"

1794
01:42:14,950 --> 01:42:16,660
Wow! I've found the perfect item!

1795
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:25,200
âª We shall never break this friendship of ours âª
Song from 'Sholay'

1796
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:27,950
I'll give you one chance.

1797
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:29,870
Heads or tails?

1798
01:42:31,450 --> 01:42:32,750
-Heads!
-Wait!

1799
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:35,330
If it's heads,
I will kill you.

1800
01:42:36,410 --> 01:42:37,410
If it's tails, I won't.

1801
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:50,040
Hey Ram!

1802
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:54,620
Even your relics are saying
that I should kill you.

1803
01:42:55,950 --> 01:42:56,950
Heads!

1804
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:03,040
Death by relics.

1805
01:43:07,790 --> 01:43:12,870
The cricket bat used by Kapil
Dev when he scored 175...

1806
01:43:15,290 --> 01:43:16,330
Wow!

1807
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,790
Is this for real?

1808
01:43:20,660 --> 01:43:22,790
No one could watch
that innings back then.

1809
01:43:22,950 --> 01:43:24,330
BBC was on strike.

1810
01:43:24,790 --> 01:43:25,790
But today,

1811
01:43:26,290 --> 01:43:28,790
the highlights of that
thunderous innings,

1812
01:43:29,250 --> 01:43:30,870
you can watch it live.

1813
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:46,330
Wow!

1814
01:43:46,910 --> 01:43:47,950
Abdu...

1815
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:49,950
-Potty, stop him.
-Stop it!

1816
01:43:54,660 --> 01:43:55,870
Well...

1817
01:43:56,290 --> 01:43:58,750
I need a ball to play cricket.

1818
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:00,200
Ball?

1819
01:44:00,620 --> 01:44:01,620
Yes!

1820
01:44:01,750 --> 01:44:05,080
The foundation stone of my
palace which was demolished.

1821
01:44:05,950 --> 01:44:08,790
Let it be our cricket
ball for tonight.

1822
01:44:08,910 --> 01:44:09,910
Hey Potty!

1823
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:10,950
You do the bowling.

1824
01:44:12,950 --> 01:44:14,200
Do you remember?

1825
01:44:14,830 --> 01:44:18,330
These guys never gave you
bowling or batting back then.

1826
01:44:19,290 --> 01:44:20,540
You were always the umpire.

1827
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:22,330
Potty Bird!

1828
01:44:24,370 --> 01:44:25,830
Today you will bowl...

1829
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,410
I will bat,

1830
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,290
and he will be the umpire.

1831
01:44:34,120 --> 01:44:35,120
This...

1832
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:36,870
... will be our stumps.

1833
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:41,080
Throw it.

1834
01:44:43,620 --> 01:44:44,700
Throw it!

1835
01:44:48,540 --> 01:44:49,580
We'll know now,

1836
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:53,330
if this is Kapil Dev's original bat,

1837
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:57,370
or fake like Saddam Hussein's wine.

1838
01:45:00,290 --> 01:45:02,120
Okay.
First ball.

1839
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,370
Shot!

1840
01:45:40,950 --> 01:45:42,370
This is original, indeed!

1841
01:45:43,450 --> 01:45:45,120
He should have been here too.

1842
01:45:45,290 --> 01:45:46,290
Kalyan Menon!

1843
01:45:46,950 --> 01:45:48,910
-Where is he?
-He is in the Police.

1844
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:50,330
He's a DIG.

1845
01:45:50,330 --> 01:45:51,750
-He will come now.
-It's alright.

1846
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:53,200
He's a cop, right?

1847
01:45:53,790 --> 01:45:55,410
He'll come only after
the villain dies.

1848
01:45:55,450 --> 01:45:56,750
He's also a partner
in this company.

1849
01:45:56,790 --> 01:45:58,080
It's not like messing with me.

1850
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:00,580
Hey Ram!

1851
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:03,950
If your father was the
Dhritharashtra in this story,

1852
01:46:03,950 --> 01:46:05,410
Advocate Menon was the Shakuni.

1853
01:46:05,450 --> 01:46:07,120
If you are Duryodhan,

1854
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:08,660
he is Dusshasan.

1855
01:46:09,830 --> 01:46:13,160
So first, I'll break your thigh!

1856
01:46:13,870 --> 01:46:16,080
After that, I will
tear open his chest!

1857
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:18,580
Hey Potty!

1858
01:46:18,790 --> 01:46:19,790
Announce the score.

1859
01:46:19,910 --> 01:46:20,910
Six!

1860
01:46:20,910 --> 01:46:23,160
Hail Lakshman Sena!

1861
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:25,450
Hail Kothadiyaji!

1862
01:46:25,450 --> 01:46:28,950
Hail Chandran Pillaji!

1863
01:46:28,950 --> 01:46:32,620
Hail Lakshman Sena!

1864
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:35,950
Hail Kothadiyaji!

1865
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,750
Hail Chandran Pillaji!

1866
01:46:39,790 --> 01:46:44,330
Hail Lakshman Sena!

1867
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,330
My dear people,

1868
01:46:47,870 --> 01:46:50,120
The fireworks are about to begin.

1869
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:52,910
For your kind attention,

1870
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:55,790
no one should go
towards that area.

1871
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:58,250
Before the fireworks begin,

1872
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:03,540
All India Lakshman Sena's
constant companion,

1873
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:10,870
and the famous DJ Arun Singh Keshav
will be presenting a brand new song.

1874
01:47:10,910 --> 01:47:14,540
A brand new song in
praise of Lakshman Sena...

1875
01:47:14,540 --> 01:47:16,540
...will be performed on this stage.

1876
01:47:47,410 --> 01:47:52,330

Hail, the Lion of the South,

Hail Lakshman Sena!

1881
01:48:11,370 --> 01:48:14,540
Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail!

1882
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:43,370

âª Let victory prevail âª

1900
01:50:11,370 --> 01:50:14,500

âª YES! YES! YES! YES!

1931
01:52:33,830 --> 01:52:35,410
Ram, do something!

1932
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:39,040
Get me the iPad.

1933
01:52:39,410 --> 01:52:40,410
Get me that tablet!

1934
01:52:47,830 --> 01:52:49,450
Switch off the lights
when I tell you.

1935
01:52:49,830 --> 01:52:50,830
Give me your phone.

1936
01:52:51,790 --> 01:52:52,790
Fast!

1937
01:52:59,790 --> 01:53:00,830
Tab.

1938
01:53:05,410 --> 01:53:06,410
Turn it off.

1939
01:53:36,750 --> 01:53:37,950
Hello guests.

1940
01:53:38,700 --> 01:53:40,910
My name is Anastasia Ober.

1941
01:53:41,200 --> 01:53:43,450
-And I am the founder, initiator..
-Go and check on him.

1942
01:53:44,790 --> 01:53:46,120
No. Ram will handle it.

1943
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:47,580
May you revel amongst relics.

1944
01:53:47,620 --> 01:53:49,200
Isn't this our old white lady?

1945
01:53:49,250 --> 01:53:50,790
So enjoy your stay...

1946
01:53:51,410 --> 01:53:53,000
... in the Accadio fun room.

1947
01:53:58,450 --> 01:53:59,950
You caught hold of her too?

1948
01:53:59,950 --> 01:54:01,450
Mythili!
Mythili!

1949
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:02,790
-Switch on the lights, Mythili!
-You schmuck!

1950
01:54:02,830 --> 01:54:03,700
Mythili!

1951
01:54:03,750 --> 01:54:04,830
Yes, it's back!

1952
01:54:17,790 --> 01:54:18,910
Come on!

1953
01:54:22,250 --> 01:54:23,290
Come!

1954
01:54:45,160 --> 01:54:46,830
That's a great shot, Marakkar!

1955
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:48,450
Marakkar, damn it!

1956
01:55:04,950 --> 01:55:06,580
Hey Ram!

1957
01:55:06,790 --> 01:55:09,410
Nunchaku and Karate
are not meant for you!

1958
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:14,580
The 'Mohiniyattam'
dance suits you best!

1959
01:55:17,410 --> 01:55:20,540
You idiot! Be careful.
You will hurt yourself with it.

1960
01:55:25,330 --> 01:55:26,910
I just told you, right?

1961
01:55:51,660 --> 01:55:53,080
Abdu, let him go!

1962
01:55:53,250 --> 01:55:54,250
Enough!

1963
01:55:57,700 --> 01:55:58,750
Ram, no!

1964
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:00,330
Let go of me!

1965
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:11,120
Ram, that's enough.

1966
01:56:11,580 --> 01:56:12,620
Abdu!

1967
01:56:12,700 --> 01:56:13,870
Ram, stop it!

1968
01:56:15,330 --> 01:56:16,500
Abdu, let him go!

1969
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:22,160
You....

1970
01:56:22,910 --> 01:56:24,450
You will shoot Gandhiji?

1971
01:56:25,290 --> 01:56:26,330
Will you?

1972
01:56:32,370 --> 01:56:33,910
Potty, stop them!

1973
01:56:33,950 --> 01:56:35,910
Hey Potty! Come
and hold the gun!

1974
01:56:36,910 --> 01:56:38,290
Abdu, let him go!

1975
01:56:38,620 --> 01:56:39,870
Abdu!

1976
01:56:41,370 --> 01:56:42,450
Abdu!

1977
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:44,410
Abdullah, let go of him!

1978
01:56:44,540 --> 01:56:45,660
Please stop!

1979
01:56:46,620 --> 01:56:48,000
Ram!
Ram!

1980
01:56:48,290 --> 01:56:50,870
-Move away, Mythili Devi.
-Ram, no!

1981
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:57,080
Ram!

1982
01:56:57,830 --> 01:56:58,950
Don't hit him, Ram!

1983
01:57:11,870 --> 01:57:13,120
Ram, stop!

1984
01:57:13,160 --> 01:57:14,250
You bloody dog!

1985
01:57:14,290 --> 01:57:16,370
If we snatched away
your father's property,

1986
01:57:16,370 --> 01:57:17,910
that's because of his incapability.

1987
01:57:17,950 --> 01:57:19,450
If he shot himself dead,

1988
01:57:19,450 --> 01:57:20,790
that's his foolishness!

1989
01:57:20,830 --> 01:57:22,620
I am both the Judge and the Jury here!

1990
01:57:23,160 --> 01:57:24,200
Enough, Ram!

1991
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:30,200
Ram!

1992
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:33,870
This is the verdict.
The finale!

1993
01:57:36,330 --> 01:57:37,950
The real Death Penalty.

1994
01:57:41,790 --> 01:57:42,870
Death... for me.

1995
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,750
Penalty... for you.

1996
01:58:13,700 --> 01:58:14,700
Ram!

1997
01:58:15,080 --> 01:58:17,080
Ram, check if he's still alive.

1998
01:58:33,330 --> 01:58:34,330
He's dead.

1999
01:58:35,250 --> 01:58:36,250
Abdu!

2000
01:58:38,450 --> 01:58:39,910
Abdu!

2001
01:58:40,290 --> 01:58:41,950
Abdu! Abdu!

2002
01:58:49,790 --> 01:58:51,000
You killed him?

2003
01:58:52,290 --> 01:58:53,330
He...

2004
01:58:54,580 --> 01:58:55,750
He was going to...

2005
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:27,950
Ram...

2006
01:59:27,950 --> 01:59:29,120
It's Kalyan.

2007
01:59:29,540 --> 01:59:30,580
Talk to him.

2008
01:59:33,290 --> 01:59:35,450
-Kalyan...
-Bro, what do I say!

2009
01:59:35,790 --> 01:59:38,540
That braggart DGP made a lightning
visit to the Commissioner's office.

2010
01:59:38,540 --> 01:59:40,870
A new Commissioner has taken charge.
A new posting.

2011
01:59:41,330 --> 01:59:42,950
A hot-headed a*****e.

2012
01:59:43,620 --> 01:59:44,620
And on top of all this,

2013
01:59:44,620 --> 01:59:46,250
there's a mess of a meeting as well.

2014
01:59:46,450 --> 01:59:47,540
I got free only now.

2015
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,450
I'll go home, change my clothes
and come there quickly.

2016
01:59:50,750 --> 01:59:51,750
Okay?

2017
01:59:52,830 --> 01:59:53,830
Hey!

2018
01:59:53,950 --> 01:59:56,200
The resort must be stunning
after your renovation, right?

2019
01:59:56,410 --> 01:59:58,000
I need to see it fully
once I get there.

2020
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59,040
I'll be there soon.

2021
01:59:59,580 --> 02:00:00,830
And one more thing.

2022
02:00:01,250 --> 02:00:02,870
Though you offered
us 20% of the profit,

2023
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:06,160
my father and myself have only received
Rs. 1.5 Million from you till date,

2024
02:00:06,160 --> 02:00:07,620
ever since the deal was closed.

2025
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:08,870
So when I come there tonight,

2026
02:00:08,870 --> 02:00:11,830
give me Rs. 20 Million in cash first,
and settle all the old accounts.

2027
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:13,580
You can show your
hospitality after that.

2028
02:00:13,580 --> 02:00:14,580
Got it?

2029
02:00:24,410 --> 02:00:25,410
Kalyan sir.

2030
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,160
He is their stooge here.

2031
02:00:27,700 --> 02:00:30,660
He's putting on this dumb act,
though he's aware of everything.

2032
02:00:31,660 --> 02:00:32,660
I know, I know.

2033
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,700
Sir, when this Covid
situation is prevailing,

2034
02:00:34,750 --> 02:00:35,830
we should not be allowing...

2035
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:39,120
...a meeting of this scale,
under any circumstance.

2036
02:00:39,160 --> 02:00:41,870
-We can't even insist them to wear masks.
-You tell me then.

2037
02:00:42,250 --> 02:00:44,080
What should I do?
Should I do a Lathi charge?

2038
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:45,870
If I upset them,
they will brand me an anti-National.

2039
02:00:45,910 --> 02:00:48,000
If I upset them, they will brand
me a Sanghi or a Muslim extremist.

2040
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:50,500
The police department lost
its honour and power long back!

2041
02:00:50,620 --> 02:00:52,250
Even if we want to take action,

2042
02:00:52,250 --> 02:00:55,330
there will be a Lathi charge
against us on social media tomorrow.

2043
02:01:15,580 --> 02:01:17,370
After a glaring gap of five years,

2044
02:01:17,410 --> 02:01:20,040
have they both come to reinstate
their Kerala business empire!

2045
02:01:20,160 --> 02:01:24,500
The Accadio South East Asia power
couple, Ramkumar and Mythili.

2046
02:01:24,830 --> 02:01:28,080
Please accept this hearty welcome from
your humble partner and Kerala Police.

2047
02:01:29,370 --> 02:01:30,910
Please accept this bouquet.

2048
02:01:31,910 --> 02:01:33,660
That crappy car lying outside?
Whose is it?

2049
02:01:33,660 --> 02:01:34,910
Brahmand Solutions?

2050
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,120
What happened?

2051
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:38,660
Any sentimental attachment?

2052
02:01:39,870 --> 02:01:40,870
Something has happened.

2053
02:01:42,290 --> 02:01:43,870
Something terrible has happened.

2054
02:01:55,660 --> 02:01:56,950
Do you know how he got here?

2055
02:01:57,500 --> 02:01:58,500
Did he have a vehicle?

2056
02:01:59,950 --> 02:02:01,000
I'm asking you.

2057
02:02:02,450 --> 02:02:05,250
No... but we had
met him in the city.

2058
02:02:06,370 --> 02:02:07,450
And?

2059
02:02:07,910 --> 02:02:10,620
And he enquired about Ram to us.

2060
02:02:10,660 --> 02:02:13,160
But we avoided him
without giving him an answer.

2061
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Where all are the CCTV
cameras installed here?

2062
02:02:21,290 --> 02:02:22,330
I need its footage.

2063
02:02:22,450 --> 02:02:23,450
If you have that,

2064
02:02:23,500 --> 02:02:26,160
we can call this an intrusion and claim
that the murder was in self-defense.

2065
02:02:26,250 --> 02:02:27,250
Where is the server?

2066
02:02:31,250 --> 02:02:32,500
It hasn't been installed.

2067
02:02:35,410 --> 02:02:36,410
Great!

2068
02:02:36,870 --> 02:02:38,620
World's greatest luxury chain!

2069
02:02:39,660 --> 02:02:40,660
Great!

2070
02:02:40,790 --> 02:02:42,160
Did he have a phone?

2071
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:47,660
Ram, it might be
in the fun room.

2072
02:02:48,540 --> 02:02:50,200
Mythili, go and check there.

2073
02:02:50,450 --> 02:02:51,790
Prabha, you go there.

2074
02:02:52,120 --> 02:02:53,120
Go!

2075
02:02:54,330 --> 02:02:55,330
Mythili, over there.

2076
02:03:53,370 --> 02:03:54,700
Found it!
Found his phone!

2077
02:03:55,160 --> 02:03:56,160
Here!

2078
02:03:57,660 --> 02:03:59,660
Mythili, he found the phone.
Come.

2079
02:04:00,290 --> 02:04:01,290
-Here you go.
-Hey Potty!

2080
02:04:01,700 --> 02:04:02,750
You're quite impressive.

2081
02:04:02,790 --> 02:04:04,080
Covering it in a handkerchief?

2082
02:04:04,120 --> 02:04:05,620
Well, I have seen it in movies.

2083
02:04:06,700 --> 02:04:07,700
Nice!

2084
02:04:09,660 --> 02:04:11,450
Hey Ram! I found
this under the sofa.

2085
02:04:18,870 --> 02:04:19,870
Keep this safe.

2086
02:04:19,950 --> 02:04:20,950
Okay.

2087
02:04:30,750 --> 02:04:31,750
Ram!

2088
02:04:31,950 --> 02:04:32,950
Search his pockets.

2089
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,410
What's that paper?

2090
02:04:43,580 --> 02:04:44,580
It's the bill from a bar.

2091
02:04:45,200 --> 02:04:46,250
Potty....

2092
02:04:48,750 --> 02:04:49,750
What's that?

2093
02:04:51,080 --> 02:04:52,540
Nexito.

2094
02:04:56,450 --> 02:04:57,910
Anti-depressant.

2095
02:05:01,580 --> 02:05:02,580
Give it to Potty.

2096
02:05:04,830 --> 02:05:06,040
Check his back-pockets.

2097
02:05:12,540 --> 02:05:13,580
Give it to Potty.

2098
02:05:15,500 --> 02:05:17,370
Pack all of it together,
and keep it there.

2099
02:05:18,580 --> 02:05:19,580
Mythili!

2100
02:05:19,620 --> 02:05:20,910
Get me the bouquet I brought.

2101
02:05:29,830 --> 02:05:30,830
Ram!

2102
02:05:31,330 --> 02:05:32,830
Take out a flower
from the bouquet.

2103
02:05:34,870 --> 02:05:35,870
Come on, do it.

2104
02:05:39,660 --> 02:05:40,950
You have killed him anyway.

2105
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:42,410
Before taking the next step,

2106
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:43,620
confess all the sins...

2107
02:05:43,660 --> 02:05:46,620
...that you and your father committed
towards Abdu and his family,

2108
02:05:46,910 --> 02:05:49,330
and place that rose
flower on his chest.

2109
02:05:50,250 --> 02:05:51,250
What about your father?

2110
02:05:51,790 --> 02:05:52,790
That's not relevant now.

2111
02:05:53,620 --> 02:05:54,910
This was really too much!

2112
02:05:56,660 --> 02:05:57,910
Though it's you who killed him,

2113
02:05:58,200 --> 02:05:59,410
it is he who has really won.

2114
02:05:59,500 --> 02:06:00,580
How?
I'll tell you later.

2115
02:06:01,370 --> 02:06:02,660
Place that flower there, first.

2116
02:06:04,660 --> 02:06:05,660
Keep it.

2117
02:06:21,080 --> 02:06:22,830
The Abdullah Marakkar that I know...

2118
02:06:23,080 --> 02:06:24,660
... might be capable
of all this rampage.

2119
02:06:25,830 --> 02:06:27,200
But what you did to him now...

2120
02:06:27,290 --> 02:06:28,540
he wouldn't have ever
done the same to you.

2121
02:06:29,500 --> 02:06:30,500
I'm sure about that.

2122
02:06:30,540 --> 02:06:31,540
Hey Kalyan!

2123
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Save me!

2124
02:06:33,660 --> 02:06:34,660
Help me!

2125
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:38,080
Help us!

2126
02:06:39,790 --> 02:06:40,910
I will.

2127
02:06:40,950 --> 02:06:41,950
I'll manage this.

2128
02:06:42,910 --> 02:06:46,500
But I will have to engage the entire
state machinery under me, for this.

2129
02:06:47,120 --> 02:06:48,250
And it will be really...

2130
02:06:48,700 --> 02:06:50,410
really, really expensive.

2131
02:06:51,410 --> 02:06:52,660
First, some hard cash.

2132
02:06:52,910 --> 02:06:53,950
And later on,

2133
02:06:53,950 --> 02:06:57,290
the expenditure to maintain the status
quo of this crime in the future.

2134
02:06:57,540 --> 02:06:58,700
I'll tell you very frankly.

2135
02:07:00,370 --> 02:07:01,370
This...

2136
02:07:02,500 --> 02:07:05,540
... is going to be a lifelong
regular entry in your balance-sheet.

2137
02:07:13,410 --> 02:07:15,450
Now, did you
understand how he won?

2138
02:07:16,540 --> 02:07:17,830
When you kill the powerless,

2139
02:07:18,250 --> 02:07:19,950
they win the war with
their very own death.

2140
02:07:24,910 --> 02:07:26,370
Can you please spare the rhetoric?

2141
02:07:26,910 --> 02:07:28,450
How much will it cost?
Tell me that.

2142
02:07:30,040 --> 02:07:31,080
8 Crores.

2143
02:07:31,870 --> 02:07:33,200
8 Crores?

2144
02:07:33,950 --> 02:07:34,950
What the...!!

2145
02:07:35,950 --> 02:07:37,290
Are you blackmailing me?

2146
02:07:37,580 --> 02:07:39,290
How dare you, you snake?

2147
02:07:39,370 --> 02:07:40,370
You forgot one thing.

2148
02:07:40,620 --> 02:07:42,040
You're also a partner in this.

2149
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:44,120
For everything that
happened in this property,

2150
02:07:44,200 --> 02:07:45,500
you are also responsible.

2151
02:07:49,790 --> 02:07:52,200
This is a property registered
in the name of Vikraman Nair,

2152
02:07:52,250 --> 02:07:53,910
and his heir Ramkumar Nair.

2153
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:56,120
As per the deal with Accadio Saket,

2154
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:58,500
Advocate Krishna Menon
and his son Kalyan Menon,

2155
02:07:58,830 --> 02:08:00,910
will have a share in the
profits from this business.

2156
02:08:02,370 --> 02:08:04,700
Anything that happens within the
privacy of this property,

2157
02:08:04,750 --> 02:08:06,870
be it debauchery or murder,

2158
02:08:07,410 --> 02:08:09,040
its complete responsibility...

2159
02:08:09,200 --> 02:08:12,000
will solely be upon Accadio's
South-East Asia head Ramkumar,

2160
02:08:12,660 --> 02:08:15,120
and quality control
head Mythili Ramkumar.

2161
02:08:15,700 --> 02:08:16,700
Moreover,

2162
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:18,660
you just grabbed
the collar of...

2163
02:08:19,080 --> 02:08:21,200
.. a Police DIG with
high political affluence.

2164
02:08:22,200 --> 02:08:24,250
So if you want to see
yourself out of this...

2165
02:08:24,660 --> 02:08:26,080
the initial sum will be,

2166
02:08:26,250 --> 02:08:27,250
8 Crores!

2167
02:08:31,200 --> 02:08:32,200
Ram!

2168
02:08:32,790 --> 02:08:35,160
You have half an hour
to take a decision.

2169
02:08:35,950 --> 02:08:37,120
Do you want to go to jail...

2170
02:08:37,580 --> 02:08:38,870
.. or do you want all this back?

2171
02:08:40,290 --> 02:08:41,830
Come with me.
Just a second.

2172
02:08:47,160 --> 02:08:48,160
Bro...

2173
02:08:48,580 --> 02:08:50,370
Though I keep bluffing unnecessarily...

2174
02:08:50,750 --> 02:08:52,660
to make my business flourish,

2175
02:08:53,160 --> 02:08:54,200
the truth is that...

2176
02:08:55,250 --> 02:08:58,000
... my financial situation is not so great,
unlike what you think.

2177
02:08:58,870 --> 02:09:00,750
Did you see all
these broken relics?

2178
02:09:02,830 --> 02:09:04,160
All are duplicate items.

2179
02:09:05,370 --> 02:09:06,370
It's just for show-off.

2180
02:09:06,370 --> 02:09:07,410
Oh!

2181
02:09:07,830 --> 02:09:09,830
Why didn't you tell this
to me all this while?

2182
02:09:11,200 --> 02:09:14,250
Well, I'm also supposed to be a
silent partner in all this, right?

2183
02:09:15,450 --> 02:09:16,790
Kalyan! Only this 8 acres,

2184
02:09:17,450 --> 02:09:18,870
and this building which is mine,

2185
02:09:19,120 --> 02:09:20,120
as well as yours.

2186
02:09:20,700 --> 02:09:22,450
I only have this 'Saket'
property with me.

2187
02:09:23,370 --> 02:09:24,540
-What I make from..
-Hey! Hey!

2188
02:09:24,580 --> 02:09:25,580
Stop it!

2189
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:27,080
What did you call me earlier?

2190
02:09:27,250 --> 02:09:28,250
A snake, right?

2191
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:31,540
Indeed, I am a venomous snake.

2192
02:09:31,910 --> 02:09:32,910
But...

2193
02:09:32,910 --> 02:09:35,200
there's that proverbial snake, that
bites the one struck by lightning.

2194
02:09:35,250 --> 02:09:36,620
I'm not that type.
Got it?

2195
02:09:38,540 --> 02:09:40,250
Okay.
Since you have requested so much,

2196
02:09:41,160 --> 02:09:42,540
I can reduce half a Crore.

2197
02:09:42,700 --> 02:09:43,700
So, it's 7.5 Crores.

2198
02:09:43,790 --> 02:09:44,790
No more bargaining.

2199
02:09:44,910 --> 02:09:45,910
This is final.

2200
02:09:46,080 --> 02:09:48,040
And you don't have to give
me anything hereafter,

2201
02:09:48,040 --> 02:09:49,620
in the name of this
silent partnership.

2202
02:09:49,660 --> 02:09:50,660
Okay?

2203
02:09:50,870 --> 02:09:53,040
Aren't you happy, bro?
This is all I can do!

2204
02:09:53,120 --> 02:09:54,500
Hey! In this situation,

2205
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:57,160
if I have to raise even a
penny more than three Crores,

2206
02:09:57,160 --> 02:09:58,830
I need to beg the
loan shark Marwadi.

2207
02:09:59,540 --> 02:10:02,000
I'll be ruined paying those
extremely high interests. Please!

2208
02:10:02,080 --> 02:10:06,580
So, the 116 resorts around the world
which you used to talk about, so far?

2209
02:10:06,620 --> 02:10:07,750
It was all bluff, brother!

2210
02:10:07,910 --> 02:10:08,910
Total bluff!

2211
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:11,080
Ram!

2212
02:10:11,830 --> 02:10:12,830
One minute.

2213
02:10:13,080 --> 02:10:14,120
Go!

2214
02:10:14,410 --> 02:10:15,450
Go ahead!

2215
02:10:21,330 --> 02:10:22,950
Bloody opportunistic dog!

2216
02:10:25,540 --> 02:10:26,540
What will we do?

2217
02:10:27,500 --> 02:10:29,040
Let's just agree to his conditions.

2218
02:10:29,580 --> 02:10:30,580
We don't have a choice.

2219
02:10:41,540 --> 02:10:42,580
I'm sorry.

2220
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:49,620
Let's go deal with him.

2221
02:10:51,160 --> 02:10:52,410
Childhood friend!

2222
02:10:54,790 --> 02:10:55,790
What's all this, dude?

2223
02:10:56,250 --> 02:10:57,370
It's his handiwork.

2224
02:11:01,580 --> 02:11:02,580
We are ready.

2225
02:11:03,620 --> 02:11:05,080
Don't misunderstand me, Mythili.

2226
02:11:06,120 --> 02:11:08,660
I won't take even a single Rupee
from what you're giving me.

2227
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:11,250
That is to destroy all
the evidence in this case,

2228
02:11:11,580 --> 02:11:14,120
and to maintain the
status quo for ages.

2229
02:11:14,330 --> 02:11:15,540
To the last shilling of it.

2230
02:11:16,200 --> 02:11:17,500
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

2231
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:20,330
Ram, just a minute.

2232
02:11:20,580 --> 02:11:22,080
-I have to tell you something.
-What?

2233
02:11:22,330 --> 02:11:23,870
Potty! In between this?

2234
02:11:24,250 --> 02:11:25,580
It's really urgent.

2235
02:11:25,620 --> 02:11:26,660
That's why.

2236
02:11:26,660 --> 02:11:28,450
-5 minutes. Come back quickly.
-That's fine.

2237
02:11:28,750 --> 02:11:29,750
Ram, come!

2238
02:11:30,910 --> 02:11:32,620
Prabha, you also come.

2239
02:11:35,750 --> 02:11:36,750
Mythili...

2240
02:11:38,410 --> 02:11:39,870
There was a servant here, right?

2241
02:11:40,330 --> 02:11:41,330
Yes.

2242
02:11:41,330 --> 02:11:42,370
There's a watchman.

2243
02:11:43,290 --> 02:11:46,290
He has gone to listen to
that Kothadiya's speech.

2244
02:11:46,790 --> 02:11:48,450
He'll come back only
in the afternoon.

2245
02:11:48,540 --> 02:11:49,540
Is he from this area?

2246
02:11:50,540 --> 02:11:51,540
No.

2247
02:11:51,660 --> 02:11:52,660
He came from Thane.

2248
02:11:52,870 --> 02:11:53,870
Oh, yes.

2249
02:11:54,250 --> 02:11:55,790
Praveen Kumar or Singh?

2250
02:11:56,120 --> 02:11:57,370
Pawanputra Bhede.

2251
02:11:57,410 --> 02:11:58,410
Yeah! Bhede!

2252
02:11:58,700 --> 02:12:00,120
Do you have his
documents with you?

2253
02:12:00,910 --> 02:12:03,250
I have copies of his
passport and Aadhaar card.

2254
02:12:03,910 --> 02:12:05,040
Good.
Bring it.

2255
02:12:05,160 --> 02:12:06,160
Okay.

2256
02:12:08,500 --> 02:12:09,500
Mythili!

2257
02:12:09,910 --> 02:12:11,580
You said he fired
the gun twice, right?

2258
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,410
Where all did the bullets strike?

2259
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:15,000
I have to recover
the bullet cases.

2260
02:12:15,700 --> 02:12:18,790
One hit the box with
Gandhiji's spectacles.

2261
02:12:19,160 --> 02:12:22,330
Another one hit the box which
had Safdar Hashmi's pen in it.

2262
02:12:25,750 --> 02:12:28,700
Both bullets have struck at
politically incorrect places.

2263
02:12:31,830 --> 02:12:33,000
What is it?

2264
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:34,540
Huh? Where are you going?
Stay there.

2265
02:12:35,250 --> 02:12:36,330
You stand here.

2266
02:12:39,250 --> 02:12:40,250
You ******!

2267
02:12:40,830 --> 02:12:44,120
You and her were fooling around on WhatsApp
and Insta for the past two years, huh?

2268
02:12:44,450 --> 02:12:45,500
You scoundrel!

2269
02:12:45,950 --> 02:12:49,080
Once, when Sudama came to his
friend Lord Krishna asking for help,

2270
02:12:49,410 --> 02:12:51,250
the Lord did greatly
help his friend.

2271
02:12:51,500 --> 02:12:52,500
But in return,

2272
02:12:53,250 --> 02:12:55,200
He didn't
ask for Sudama's wife!

2273
02:12:58,870 --> 02:13:00,620
Even though you are named Ram,

2274
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,200
you are still that
old Nair's son, right?

2275
02:13:04,200 --> 02:13:05,830
Ramkumar Nair!

2276
02:13:08,370 --> 02:13:09,370
Leave that.

2277
02:13:09,790 --> 02:13:11,500
If Kalyan has promised to solve this,

2278
02:13:11,660 --> 02:13:12,660
he will do it.

2279
02:13:12,870 --> 02:13:15,080
I'm sure about that.
He is that Advocate's son, right?

2280
02:13:15,790 --> 02:13:16,790
But...

2281
02:13:17,200 --> 02:13:18,790
if this Sudama intends to,

2282
02:13:19,200 --> 02:13:20,910
he can turn this game
on its head, right away.

2283
02:13:20,950 --> 02:13:21,750
Hey!

2284
02:13:21,790 --> 02:13:23,410
You have only one way.

2285
02:13:23,410 --> 02:13:24,660
Like him, make me also...

2286
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:26,250
... a Kubera!

2287
02:13:27,500 --> 02:13:28,540
What do you mean?

2288
02:13:28,830 --> 02:13:29,830
5 Crores!

2289
02:13:30,540 --> 02:13:32,330
5 Crores?

2290
02:13:33,500 --> 02:13:34,660
Dude!

2291
02:13:34,660 --> 02:13:37,620
Even Amitabh Bachchan gives away
5 Crores to 3rd runners up in KBC.

2292
02:13:37,620 --> 02:13:39,080
So don't tell me that.

2293
02:13:39,250 --> 02:13:40,910
It's not such a huge
sum in today's age.

2294
02:13:41,580 --> 02:13:43,120
Brahmand Solutions!

2295
02:13:43,410 --> 02:13:44,790
All debts cleared!

2296
02:13:44,830 --> 02:13:45,830
CEO,

2297
02:13:46,120 --> 02:13:47,500
Parameshwaran Potty.

2298
02:13:47,750 --> 02:13:49,120
P-O-T-T-Y.

2299
02:13:50,080 --> 02:13:53,200
And... I got a call earlier, right?

2300
02:13:53,870 --> 02:13:55,120
I had told him then,

2301
02:13:55,290 --> 02:13:57,450
that I had come to meet
Ramkumar at Vadakara.

2302
02:13:57,660 --> 02:13:59,700
So, don't think that
you can get rid of me.

2303
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Got it?

2304
02:14:01,660 --> 02:14:02,660
5 Crores!

2305
02:14:02,830 --> 02:14:03,830
Bank transfer.

2306
02:14:04,500 --> 02:14:06,120
I have nothing to lose.

2307
02:14:06,870 --> 02:14:07,870
Go.

2308
02:14:08,200 --> 02:14:09,200
Go downstairs.

2309
02:14:13,790 --> 02:14:14,790
Hey Ram!

2310
02:14:15,580 --> 02:14:16,580
Free lunch, huh?

2311
02:14:17,160 --> 02:14:18,580
Bloody dog!

2312
02:14:20,250 --> 02:14:21,250
Go!

2313
02:14:26,200 --> 02:14:28,120
So, it was you who
called Abdu here?

2314
02:14:33,870 --> 02:14:35,200
This condition is called,

2315
02:14:36,250 --> 02:14:38,540
floccinaucinihilipilification.

2316
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Shashi...

2317
02:14:42,080 --> 02:14:43,080
Tharoor!

2318
02:15:03,200 --> 02:15:04,750
Is the speed-boat
lying outside yours?

2319
02:15:05,200 --> 02:15:07,120
-Yes, it's mine.
-We'll need it.

2320
02:15:09,620 --> 02:15:10,620
Prabha...

2321
02:15:10,830 --> 02:15:14,910
Get me the overcoats and
hats of Hitler and Mussolini.

2322
02:15:17,250 --> 02:15:19,250
Mythili, this place should
be clean when we come back.

2323
02:15:19,290 --> 02:15:20,910
Not a speck of this
mess should remain.

2324
02:15:21,200 --> 02:15:23,500
Potty, watch whether someone
is coming from outside.

2325
02:15:23,500 --> 02:15:25,290
-Lock the gate from inside.
-Okay.

2326
02:15:28,500 --> 02:15:29,500
Ram!

2327
02:15:29,750 --> 02:15:30,750
Take this dagger,

2328
02:15:32,200 --> 02:15:33,620
and that piece of stone.

2329
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Bring them both.

2330
02:15:35,040 --> 02:15:36,040
What for?

2331
02:15:36,410 --> 02:15:37,540
Just do as I say!

2332
02:15:46,200 --> 02:15:48,000
The beach has good
visibility even at night.

2333
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:49,290
Even the sea is not 100% safe.

2334
02:15:49,370 --> 02:15:51,040
The beam from the
lighthouse is an issue.

2335
02:16:18,700 --> 02:16:19,700
Get up.

2336
02:16:22,330 --> 02:16:23,250
Take that dagger.

2337
02:16:23,290 --> 02:16:24,330
Jhansi Rani's dagger.

2338
02:16:25,750 --> 02:16:26,790
I won't touch the body.

2339
02:16:27,080 --> 02:16:28,450
Just do as I say.

2340
02:16:28,580 --> 02:16:29,580
Got me?

2341
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:38,120
What?

2342
02:16:38,790 --> 02:16:40,700
I get dizzy when I see blood.

2343
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:42,040
I'll faint.

2344
02:16:43,040 --> 02:16:44,450
Deja vu moment.

2345
02:16:45,120 --> 02:16:48,830
Nair, if people without a conscience,
start acting like they have conscience,

2346
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:50,410
it will not only be
difficult for them,

2347
02:16:50,410 --> 02:16:52,620
but also for the others
who are trying to help them out.

2348
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:55,580
So, stop this acting first.

2349
02:16:55,910 --> 02:16:56,950
Come here.

2350
02:16:57,750 --> 02:16:58,750
Come on!

2351
02:16:59,870 --> 02:17:00,870
Sit down.

2352
02:17:01,580 --> 02:17:02,580
Sit down.

2353
02:17:03,660 --> 02:17:05,790
What are you waiting for?
Cut him open.

2354
02:17:05,790 --> 02:17:06,830
Come on!

2355
02:17:11,790 --> 02:17:12,870
From the side...

2356
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:16,160
Do it properly!

2357
02:17:16,910 --> 02:17:17,910
Cut through the sides.

2358
02:17:19,830 --> 02:17:21,040
Open him up properly.

2359
02:17:22,750 --> 02:17:23,750
Open it.

2360
02:17:25,580 --> 02:17:26,870
Put that stone
inside his stomach.

2361
02:17:26,910 --> 02:17:27,910
Keep it inside.

2362
02:17:33,160 --> 02:17:34,500
Now tie it up with the cloth.

2363
02:17:35,290 --> 02:17:36,290
Tighten it on that side.

2364
02:17:39,410 --> 02:17:40,410
Get up.

2365
02:17:42,790 --> 02:17:44,120
Throw the body into the water.

2366
02:17:53,330 --> 02:17:54,370
Go ahead.

2367
02:17:55,500 --> 02:17:56,580
Come on!

2368
02:18:13,370 --> 02:18:15,410
Now we have to leave this
Hitler & Mussolini in the sea.

2369
02:18:15,450 --> 02:18:16,450
Don't leave any trace.

2370
02:18:47,330 --> 02:18:49,000
Why are you crying
like this, you loser?

2371
02:18:49,330 --> 02:18:51,250
You've joined the club of
celebrated murderers now.

2372
02:18:51,250 --> 02:18:52,290
Be proud!

2373
02:18:52,290 --> 02:18:53,750
That's your only option.

2374
02:18:54,580 --> 02:18:55,950
There won't be any
problem, right?

2375
02:18:57,040 --> 02:18:58,040
Will he come back?

2376
02:18:58,660 --> 02:19:00,790
Usually the body comes back
on the third day, right?

2377
02:19:01,330 --> 02:19:02,330
Nothing like that.

2378
02:19:02,660 --> 02:19:05,080
Marakkar is supposed to be
the Lion of Arabian Sea, right?

2379
02:19:05,120 --> 02:19:07,040
The lions of the sea,
will be taken by the sea herself.

2380
02:19:07,080 --> 02:19:08,080
Come.

2381
02:19:18,950 --> 02:19:19,950
So, as I said...

2382
02:19:20,700 --> 02:19:21,750
When will you leave?

2383
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:23,160
We'll leave immediately.

2384
02:19:24,290 --> 02:19:25,290
Ram, come.

2385
02:19:30,950 --> 02:19:31,950
When are you leaving?

2386
02:19:32,910 --> 02:19:33,910
Day after.

2387
02:19:34,080 --> 02:19:36,200
My tickets are
booked for that day.

2388
02:19:36,450 --> 02:19:37,500
Don't skip that.

2389
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:39,370
Before you reach the airport,

2390
02:19:39,410 --> 02:19:41,120
that transfer I asked
for, should happen.

2391
02:19:42,200 --> 02:19:44,450
To the UAE Hinduja bank
account of my wife,

2392
02:19:44,450 --> 02:19:46,540
you will deposit money from
your Swiss Bank account.

2393
02:19:46,750 --> 02:19:49,410
Then, it will be transferred to my wife's
NRI account in some godforsaken bank here,

2394
02:19:49,450 --> 02:19:51,000
from where I'll withdraw it.

2395
02:19:52,160 --> 02:19:53,450
Just a trick
from your own book.

2396
02:19:54,080 --> 02:19:55,120
And...

2397
02:19:55,330 --> 02:19:56,700
don't try to act smart with me.

2398
02:19:57,160 --> 02:19:58,870
An extradition from the UK,

2399
02:19:59,080 --> 02:20:00,540
is not so difficult anymore.

2400
02:20:02,290 --> 02:20:03,290
Come here, all of you.

2401
02:20:05,450 --> 02:20:06,450
Now, relax.

2402
02:20:06,660 --> 02:20:07,660
Don't worry.

2403
02:20:08,410 --> 02:20:10,080
If I say that I'll manage it,
I'll do it.

2404
02:20:10,870 --> 02:20:11,910
You know, right?

2405
02:20:22,500 --> 02:20:23,500
Shall I leave?

2406
02:20:54,870 --> 02:20:55,910
Hail Lord Ram!

2407
02:20:58,540 --> 02:20:59,830
What happened on your face, sir?

2408
02:20:59,870 --> 02:21:00,910
It's nothing.

2409
02:21:02,200 --> 02:21:05,660
It was a superb speech by
Lakshman Kothadiyaji, Madam.

2410
02:21:06,450 --> 02:21:07,700
Why are you back so early?

2411
02:21:08,410 --> 02:21:10,410
Didn't you say that you'll
come only by afternoon?

2412
02:21:11,200 --> 02:21:12,660
Didn't you go to
your uncle's house?

2413
02:21:12,660 --> 02:21:14,120
I went there, Madam.

2414
02:21:14,290 --> 02:21:16,000
I had a blast with my friends.

2415
02:21:16,540 --> 02:21:17,950
I got drunk last night.

2416
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:19,160
I had a lot of fun.

2417
02:21:19,200 --> 02:21:20,660
So much fun at night.

2418
02:21:21,160 --> 02:21:24,580
There was a party happening
here last night, right sir?

2419
02:21:26,450 --> 02:21:28,080
Okay.
Go and clean the garden.

2420
02:21:28,790 --> 02:21:30,200
One more thing, sir.

2421
02:21:31,330 --> 02:21:34,370
While I was sleeping on
the beach last night,

2422
02:21:34,500 --> 02:21:40,200
I saw two people going
to the sea on our boat.

2423
02:21:40,870 --> 02:21:44,370
Since I was really drunk,
I fell asleep over there.

2424
02:21:44,410 --> 02:21:48,250
I thought I'll go and
check in the morning.

2425
02:21:50,120 --> 02:21:51,200
Then?

2426
02:21:52,040 --> 02:21:54,120
But... in the morning...

2427
02:21:56,450 --> 02:21:59,120
I woke up in the morning,
hearing a ruckus.

2428
02:22:00,830 --> 02:22:01,950
When I looked,

2429
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,200
some people and the police
had crowded on the beach.

2430
02:22:06,120 --> 02:22:07,870
When I went forward
to get a closer look,

2431
02:22:07,910 --> 02:22:10,120
I saw someone's chopped off hand.

2432
02:22:21,290 --> 02:22:23,290
-Sir, someone is here to see you.
-Who?

2433
02:22:23,540 --> 02:22:25,160
Who are you?
Sir wants to know.

2434
02:22:25,580 --> 02:22:27,700
Tell him that I'm his friend.
He knows me.

2435
02:22:27,750 --> 02:22:29,870
Sir, he's saying that he's your friend.

2436
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:31,450
-Send him in.
-Okay.

2437
02:22:31,910 --> 02:22:33,040
You may go in.

2438
02:22:36,830 --> 02:22:39,040
Has anyone here seen this
tattooed hand earlier?

2439
02:22:42,700 --> 02:22:45,500
-Have you?
-But I didn't tell them anything, sir.

2440
02:22:46,120 --> 02:22:49,200
At night, our boat was on that side.

2441
02:22:49,910 --> 02:22:52,200
But when I checked now in the morning,
it's on this side.

2442
02:22:52,620 --> 02:22:56,330
When I checked inside the boat
to find where it went at night,

2443
02:22:56,370 --> 02:22:57,790
I found this, sir.

2444
02:22:58,250 --> 02:23:00,450
There's something written
in Malayalam in this.

2445
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:06,500
The moon was shattered,
And moonlight, erased...

2446
02:23:07,040 --> 02:23:09,620
Didn't someone come to
meet you last night, sir?

2447
02:23:09,660 --> 02:23:10,660
Who is he?

2448
02:23:12,200 --> 02:23:14,200
I know everything!

2449
02:23:15,790 --> 02:23:17,580
But I won't tell anyone anything, sir.

2450
02:23:18,040 --> 02:23:20,410
He was a Turk, right?
Bloody Pakistani!

2451
02:23:20,620 --> 02:23:21,750
He deserved to die!

2452
02:23:23,910 --> 02:23:26,370
But I have a small request.

2453
02:23:26,910 --> 02:23:29,500
My mother is not well at all.
She is bedridden.

2454
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:33,040
I haven't been able to go
to my hometown for two years.

2455
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:34,620
For her treatment,

2456
02:23:35,250 --> 02:23:37,040
I need some money.

2457
02:23:37,910 --> 02:23:38,950
Very little.

2458
02:23:38,950 --> 02:23:40,200
For the hospital expenses.

2459
02:23:40,410 --> 02:23:41,410
How much?

2460
02:23:42,580 --> 02:23:43,580
50,000.

2461
02:23:43,830 --> 02:23:45,160
50,000 Rupees.

2462
02:23:47,500 --> 02:23:48,500
We will give it.

2463
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:50,040
Every month.

2464
02:23:50,790 --> 02:23:52,160
Every month,

2465
02:23:52,700 --> 02:23:54,580
50,000 Rupees!

2466
02:23:56,040 --> 02:23:57,410
In cash.

2467
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,290
When you kill the powerless,

2468
02:24:01,790 --> 02:24:03,660
they win the war
with their very own death.

2469
02:24:11,620 --> 02:24:12,700
Hail Lord Ram!

2470
02:24:13,410 --> 02:24:16,950
'THEERPPU'
The Settlement

2471
02:24:28,830 --> 02:24:30,120
Hello?
Cantonment police station!

2472
02:24:30,160 --> 02:24:31,160
Hello?

2473
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:32,500
I had called earlier.

2474
02:24:33,040 --> 02:24:34,040
What's the matter?

2475
02:24:34,700 --> 02:24:36,540
A man-missing case,
in Vadakara.

2476
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:38,750
I've already
registered a complaint.

2477
02:24:38,790 --> 02:24:40,200
I wanted to know about that.

2478
02:24:40,370 --> 02:24:41,500
Madam, say the name.

2479
02:24:41,540 --> 02:24:42,660
I am Dr. Shwetha.

2480
02:24:42,660 --> 02:24:44,410
Dr. Shwetha...
Not that!

2481
02:24:44,450 --> 02:24:46,040
Say the name of
the missing person!

2482
02:24:46,040 --> 02:24:48,040
Abdullah.
Abdullah Marakkar.

2483
02:24:48,580 --> 02:24:59,250
âª Where History once slept
and rose in peace.., âª

2484
02:25:01,950 --> 02:25:10,450
âª Recent wrongs
have castled up. âª

2485
02:25:19,410 --> 02:25:24,080
âª Old wounds fester here, now, âª

2486
02:25:24,120 --> 02:25:32,040
âª By the salty waves
of the sea of sin..; âª

2487
02:25:32,080 --> 02:25:35,870
âª On this night.., âª

2488
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:44,750
âª Thisâ¦ very night! âª

2489
02:25:49,910 --> 02:26:02,330
âª If happenstanceâ¦
joins hands with destiny.., here, âª

2490
02:26:02,500 --> 02:26:06,580
âª Itâs Apocalypseâ¦! âª

2491
02:26:06,620 --> 02:26:15,750
âª That blood-stained finale, âª

2492
02:26:16,120 --> 02:26:22,120
âª itâd be unimaginable! âª

2493
02:26:22,700 --> 02:26:33,290
âª Suchâ¦ is the swelling
surge of the past.., âª

2494
02:26:33,580 --> 02:26:39,660
âª The battle song of Karma! âª

2495
02:26:40,120 --> 02:26:44,080
âª The end of story? âª

2496
02:26:44,540 --> 02:26:57,250
âª Beyond beliefâ¦.!!! âª

2497
02:26:57,580 --> 02:27:10,750
âª Beyond beliefâ¦.!!! âª

1
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,290
Hail Lord Ganesha!

2
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,250
A ritual once confined only
to Maharashtra and Bengal;

3
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,870
...now they've brought it here too.

4
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,580
Total crap!

5
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,950
The colour of our
English channel...

6
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,790
...and the colour of this
goddamn sea here. Terrible!

7
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,040
Drainage, waste, trash and what not!
Shucks!

8
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,500
And if they murder someone,
those corpses too..!

9
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,290
Even 'God' gets dumped
in this sea now.

10
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,290
It's a real tragedy, you know!

11
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,160
The eco-system is
totally gone!

12
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,200
-Hey Pawan!
-Yes, sir!

13
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,700
Clear everything. Not one speck
of trash should remain there.

14
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,250
He's calling it
trash, bloody dog!!

15
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,160
Did you hear me?

16
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,660
Forgive me, Lord Ganesha!

17
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,450
I heard you!

18
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,580
"I heard you, sir!"

19
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,870
"Heard you, sir!"

20
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,450
A sea that brings everything
from there over here.

21
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,620
Who's coming for dinner?

22
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,790
Who's coming for dinner?

23
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,830
Oh!

24
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,040
Parameshwaran Potty.

25
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,250
My old school friend.

26
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,950
You postponed our return
trip by three days,

27
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,450
saying that you have a most
important business meeting,

28
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,160
for this silly get-together?

29
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,830
That too, during this Covid pandemic?

30
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,120
It's not a silly get-together, Mythili..!!

31
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,790
It's a serious business meeting!

32
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,250
He's struggling now with
plenty of debts and losses.

33
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,410
I have to help him out.

34
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,370
We shouldn't forget our roots...

35
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,750
and our old friends too.

36
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,620
That's not an essential
Ramkumar line.

37
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,040
"Help", "Our roots"...

38
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,500
Without some kind of
prize money or trophy,

39
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,410
you don't take so
much effort usually.

40
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,870
My husband,
Mr. Ramkumar Nair.

41
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,950
Now, listen...

42
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,250
Just play the host well,
and do your damn business.

43
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,410
Got it?

44
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,200
There must be someone
else with him.

45
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,250
Huh?

46
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,290
Who is it?

47
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,790
Sir!

48
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,040
What is it?

49
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,950
Sir, can I ask you something?

50
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,750
Tell me.

51
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,120
You know...

52
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,080
My leader,

53
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,200
the most respected
Mr. Lakshman Kothadia,

54
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,660
is coming to this city today.

55
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,790
So?

56
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,910
If you give me permission,

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,830
I can go there.

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,950
Get lost!
We have guests coming today.

59
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,200
Go and do your work.

60
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,830
-Go!
--Okay, sir.

61
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,500
Bloody Pawanaputra Bhede!

62
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,660
His name sounds like some king who
fought and lost against the British.

63
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,950
He's named after our God.

64
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,000
Otherwise, I'd have
gone for his throat.

65
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,250
Hey Pawan!

66
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,750
Bring me a cup of tea!

67
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,620
Yes, sir!

68
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,500
âª This night, âª

69
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,750
âª This very night! âª

70
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,160
âª The moon was shattered, âª

71
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:23,000
âª And moonlight, erased, âª

72
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,290
Namaste, countrymen!

73
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,000
I am Arnab Goswami,

74
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,160
and you are watching,
"The Nation wants to know!"

75
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,080
My dear countrymen,

76
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,830
after eight days,

77
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,870
I have come out of the prison.

78
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,790
Hey! Can you reduce
the volume of the TV?

79
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,580
What, sir?

80
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,750
Can you reduce
the volume of the TV?

81
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,950
They won't listen to me, sir.

82
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,120
They are North Indians. They are our
only customers during this Covid period.

83
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,000
They don't need
music or dance now.

84
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,120
They just want to watch
that fellow!

85
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,580
Then... ask them to shout less!

86
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,870
If the cops come hearing this noise,
all of us will be thrown out.

87
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,160
You know, right?

88
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,500
Social distancing!

89
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,950
What social distancing, sir?

90
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,910
These guys have a
convention today,

91
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,200
at our boat house grounds.

92
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,410
They have come for that.

93
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,500
Please adjust, sir.

94
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,910
I can bring the drinks to
your room upstairs, sir.

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's alright.

96
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,700
Get me the bill.

97
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,290
And pack a pint bottle too.

98
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,700
Sir, you'll be checking
out tomorrow, right?

99
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,750
Yes.

100
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:28,000
âª This night, âª

101
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,200
âª This very night! âª

102
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:48,830
âª Where History once slept
and rose in peace.., âª

âª Recent wrongs

âª The end of story? âª

âª Beyond beliefâ¦.!!! âª

116
00:09:47,120 --> 00:10:00,620
âª Beyond beliefâ¦.!!! âª

117
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,950
âª This Night, âª

118
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:33,040
âª This very night! âª

119
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,040
âª The moon was shattered, âª

120

âª And moonlight, erased, âª

âª On this very nightâ¦! âª

122
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,410
I'll try asking here.

123
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,120
Brother, where can I
buy a lamp as a gift?

124
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,040
Go straight and then
take a right turn.

125
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,370
Straight and then right?

126
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,910
-Yes.
-Thank you.

127
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,870
Hey Potty!

128
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,120
Your Holiness!

129
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,370
Hey! Wear this mask!

130
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,410
Abdullah Marakkar!

131
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
Hey specso!

132
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,540
You little devil!

133
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,040
You and your mask!

134
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,290
A much more deadly virus
is right in front of you!

135
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,120
I saw a beautiful hand.

136
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,200
Must be your better half, right?

137
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,370
Hello!

138
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,580
-What's your name?
-Her name is...

139
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:39,950
Prabha.

140
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,830
He is an old friend of mine.

141
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Abdullah.

142
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
What?

143
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,950
Old friend of yours?

144
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,040
Are there 'old' and
'new' among friends?

145
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,160
Where are you going,
searching for a lamp?

146
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,160
I'm going for a colleague's
house-warming function.

147
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,450
That's why...

148
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,950
-Where are you based now?
-Thiruvananthapuram.

149
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,580
I came here to
attend this function.

150
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,250
Thiruvananthapuram?

151
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:09,950
If you have to fill petrol and drive all
the way till here from Thiruvananthapuram,

152
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,330
your colleague must
be no ordinary guy!

153
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,290
Well, he is a close friend.

154
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,910
Apart from me, you have
only one friend here, right?

155
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,950
That bugger!

156
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,950
That bloody son of a gun, Ramkumar.

157
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,700
But he has been in England
for the past 18 years.

158
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,200
This is another friend.

159
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,580
I told you, right?
My colleague.

160
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,290
How's your mother now?

161
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:37,950
Mother!

162
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,870
So, you remember....

163
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
right?

164
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,750
She died.... a week back.

165
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,580
Didn't you go to your hometown?

166
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,620
To the place where your
ancestral house stood?

167
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
What hometown!

168
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,500
It's all gone!

169
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,950
Wiped out!

170
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,250
When I got out of
the mental asylum,

171
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,040
the first thing they
told me was...

172
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,330
... not to go back
to old places.

173
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,580
Nostaliga is not meant
for lunatics, apparently.

174
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,500
Mental asylum?

175
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,370
But...

176
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,700
Abdu hasn't forgotten
old wounds, by the way.

177
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,200
I became a lunatic because
of that wound, right?

178
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,500
He's not here, right?

179
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,120
Who?

180
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,790
Ramkumar Nair.

181
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,580
Do you have his number?

182
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,660
No.

183
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,500
He had forgotten us
long back itself, right?

184
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,700
It's been around 12 years
since I spoke to him.

185
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,410
Even if you have his number,

186
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,410
I know that you
won't give it to me.

187
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,950
But you should inform him...

188
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:59,200
that my mother who trusted, fed and took
care of him and his father, is no more now.

189
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,750
Come, let's go!

190
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,120
Oops!

191
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,330
Hey Missus!

192
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,790
I am not a troublemaker.

193
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,330
You can buy the lamp
and go at your own pace.

194
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,660
I'm leaving.

195
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,200
I was just...

196
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,330
Brahmand Solutions.

197
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,040
That's an awesome name.

198
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,330
Is that your number?

199
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:22,830
No, no.

200
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,330
This one...
The office number is different.

201
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,160
Only the landline
is functioning now.

202
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,410
You bloody veggie!

203
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,040
Oh no!

204
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,160
Forgive me!

205
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,790
Please forgive me!

206
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,160
I didn't know!

207
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,330
Well, do we really
have to buy a lamp?

208
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,750
This is a business meeting, right?

209
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,950
Of course!
We have to!

210
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,540
Let his heritage resort
have a lamp from us.

211
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,080
Who is he?

212
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,870
Indecent fellow!

213
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,450
No mask... and he was
reeking of alcohol.

214
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,580
Ramkumar, Abdullah and I studied
together in Moothedath school here.

215
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,040
Have you studied here, Potty?

216
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,870
My father was the temple priest here
at a Lord Narasimha temple, long back.

217
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,790
I studied here from my
4th to 10th grades.

218
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,500
You're still sweating quite a bit.

219
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,620
No way!

220
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,620
Seems like he was the
school bully back then.

221
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,120
-You got scared, right?
-By bully, you mean?

222
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,910
Rowdy!

223
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,410
Oh! That bully!

224
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,450
When he asked you about Ramkumar,

225
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,450
why did you lie to him?

226
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,700
Err... Well...

227
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,040
It will be a
problem if I say it.

228
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,410
Why should I...

229
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,450
Don't go there and say that we
met Abdullah on the way, okay?

230
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,200
I won't say anything.

231
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,160
What was the issue between them?

232
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,410
Tell me that story.
I'm getting bored.

233
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,410
Dad!

234
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,200
Read what's written on that poster.

235
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,370
Poster of the movie 'Midhunam'

236
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,160
Don't humiliate me, Abdu.

237
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,450
Please try, Dad.

238
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,620
The first letter is 'M'.

239
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,160
The second letter...

240
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,620
... looks like Taj Mahal
turned upside down. Doesn't it?

241
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,830
Do you like Mammookka (Mammootty)
or Lalettan (Mohanlal), Uncle?

242
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,250
Nothing like that, son. If they act
well, I like both Ikka and Ettan.

243
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,580
Whom do you like?

244
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,250
I like Rajinikanth!

245
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,450
-Wasn't it Kamal Haasan?
-Well, I changed sides.

246
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,830
Why?

247
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,330
Style!

248
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,080
Isn't that Mr. Nair?

249
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,330
Yes, Dad.

250
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,000
Come and get in, Nair.

251
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,160
Ah! Basheerkka!

252
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,330
- Come, Rama.
- No, Dad! Let's keep walking.

253
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,450
Come on!

254
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,660
-Abdu, you go to the back seat.
-Okay, Dad.

255
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,700
Hey! We were on our way there.

256
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,200
-Abdu!
-Yes!

257
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,120
Rama... Come, get inside.

258
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,540
All of you are here, huh?

259
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,120
-No. I'll get in through the other side.
-Okay.

260
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,450
His bloody car!
Show-off!

261
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,500
My umbrella!

262
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,750
Peace be unto you, Basheerkka.

263
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,200
You needn't greet
me like that, Nair.

264
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,700
You can say Namaste.

265
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,330
If so... Eid Mubarak, Basheerkka.

266
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,160
Eid Mubarak!

267
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,830
Raman gets chicken biriyani
only once in a year,

268
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,080
for this festival of yours.
Right, son?

269
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,500
Advocate Menon must
have reached, right?

270
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,080
Yes, Menon has reached.

271
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,120
I came out with Abdu,
making Menon wait at home.

272
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,080
Abdu couldn't go to school for the
past two weeks, due to typhoid.

273
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,410
So, he wanted to get some
notebooks from Potty.

274
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,700
On the way back, I
brought Potty also along.

275
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,750
Potty?
Is the High Priest home?

276
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,250
No. He has gone to the temple.

277
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,250
-Oh.
-It's the temple festival, Nair.

278
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,700
Don't you remember all this?

279
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,870
Where do I have the time
to think about all this?

280
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,410
I'm neck deep in debts.

281
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,750
You know, right?

282
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,910
Dad, they are here.

283
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,080
Allah!

284
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,250
Hey Kalyanam!

285
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,330
Don't call him that!

286
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,750
Kalyan.
That's his name.

287
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,910
Dad let me bring
the bat and ball.

288
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,290
Come, let's play.

289
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,790
Menon!

290
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,370
Did you get bored,
sitting alone?

291
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,580
-No.
-Come. Come, Nair.

292
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,330
-Rehana, Aisha..
-Yes, Mom!

293
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,540
What is it, Mom?

294
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,620
-Take this there, children.
-I'll take this.

295
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,660
Don't take that.

296
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:23,000
-Here, take this.
-I'll take this.

297
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,370
Rehana, serve Sarbath to them.

298
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,120
Which country is this
company from, Nair?

299
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,700
Advocate...

300
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,200
France.

301
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,910
-The name is Accadio.
-Oh God!

302
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,120
All over the world,

303
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,500
in all the seven continents,
they have hotels.

304
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,450
They are coming to our town too.

305
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,250
Isn't that a matter of pride, Ikka?

306
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,750
I like mutton.

307
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,290
But since you people prefer chicken,
we decided to go with Chicken Biriyani.

308
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,370
Where is Potty?

309
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,160
Different people have
different habits, right?

310
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,200
We shouldn't feed
the priest's son,

311
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:05,200
at a table where we're having
mutton, chicken and beef.

312
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,790
He's having his
vegetarian lunch inside.

313
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,160
Did you take your medicine?

314
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,290
Hey!

315
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
Have your lunch, son.

316
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,620
Give him this glass of water.

317
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,370
Have your food, Nair.

318
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,620
Ikka...

319
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,080
The party from
France has arrived.

320
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,080
They are staying at a
big hotel in Kozhikode.

321
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,700
Once you nod yes,
they will be here.

322
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:40,000
They have brought a white lady,
especially for this.

323
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,290
-Some more?
-No.

324
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,500
If it happens,

325
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,040
this will be their
first venture in Kerala.

326
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,330
And you will be the one who
benefits from this, Basheerkka.

327
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,500
Your entire future will
be secured in one go.

328
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,870
I'm aware of that.

329
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,620
But it's the land where my
ancestral house stood, Menon.

330
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,370
It's around 400 years old.

331
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,580
You know, right?

332
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,700
Jumma prayers were
offered here, earlier.

333
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,870
The property is only around 8 acres.

334
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,080
That's the only asset I can
leave behind for my children.

335
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,160
I have two daughters!

336
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,120
And I have a heart problem too.

337
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,410
We're hungry, Mother!

338
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,410
I feel really exhausted
while walking now.

339
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,450
We've been seeing each other

340
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,040
since the time we were running
around in our underpants, Basheerkka.

341
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,500
Do you have to explain
all this to us?

342
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,540
Right, Menon?

343
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,830
They just need the four acres
of land by the beach.

344
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,660
And you'll get a good price too.

345
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,250
You can use it to
buy another property,

346
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,290
or deposit it in a bank.

347
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,290
However you look at it,
it's profitable.

348
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,540
If not anything else,

349
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,250
if you want to use that
money to renovate this house,

350
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,290
you can do that too.

351
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,200
There's no point holding on saying
that it's a heirloom, Basherrkka.

352
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,870
If you can't maintain
it properly,

353
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,790
all this is just stone and sand.

354
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,450
Don't worry, Basheerkka.

355
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,620
What's the revenue that
this property generates now?

356
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,540
Just the coconuts and shoots
from these odd coconut trees.

357
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,950
If you want to chop off all these
coconut trees at this old age,

358
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,660
and start cultivating new crops,

359
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,410
it's not possible because
the wind here is salty.

360
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,290
Though you're a Marakkar,

361
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,540
since you've never
really gone to sea,

362
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,290
even fishing business
won't work for you.

363
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,080
That's true.

364
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,000
The foreigners have come
here especially because...

365
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,950
this property has
such a beach frontage.

366
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,500
When there's such an opportunity,

367
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,160
if you don't sell it for a good price,

368
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,620
you'd regret it later on.

369
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,950
I'll tell you one thing.

370
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,080
The coastal rules are going to change.

371
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,790
That's why the foreigners
are in a hurry.

372
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,080
Once the law changes,
not just them...

373
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,870
Even we can't do anything.

374
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,370
If they leave, you won't get a fair
price for that part of your land.

375
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,450
Remember that!

376
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,580
That's not what I'm thinking about.

377
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,160
I wanted to ask this to you.

378
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:15,290
How come the foreigners decided
to buy this, all of a sudden?

379
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,200
That's something which
hasn't happened so far.

380
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,290
Oh! So you didn't know?

381
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:21,910
No.

382
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,250
Who is our Prime Minister now?

383
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,660
Narasimha Rao.

384
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:33,870
He has initiated an exuberant phase which
has never happened in this country so far.

385
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,540
Have you heard about 'globalisation'?

386
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,660
No.

387
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,000
Globalisation means that...

388
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,040
One.

389
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,200
The foreigners will
give us cash in hand,

390
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,330
to run their business
in our country.

391
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,580
Two.

392
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:55,160
We accept that money and run the
foreigners' empire, right here.

393
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,660
Three.

394
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,330
It will fill the pockets of the
foreigners and us, at the same time.

395
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,160
That is globalisation.

396
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,250
How is Narasimha Rao?

397
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:08,080
How's that?

398
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,040
But... like Musaliyar said...

399
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,250
this Rao just watched
silently with his hands tied,

400
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,700
when that mosque was demolished.

401
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,580
How can he be at fault for that?

402
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,660
If so many people make up their mind
to do it, what can the Government do?

403
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,870
Enough, sister.
My stomach is full.

404
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,450
Aisha! Careful.

405
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,950
Aisha, dear...

406
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,160
Rehana...
Come here, girls.

407
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,000
Wear your Hijab properly,
clean your hands and go.

408
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,870
Whom do you wish
to marry, Rehana?

409
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,540
Aamir Khan.

410
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,750
-What about you, Aishu?
-Salman Khan.

411
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,250
You needn't take Muslim names alone,
out of your fear for me.

412
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,160
Take the names you really like.

413
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,500
-Shall I say it?
-No.

414
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,870
-Shall I say it?
-No.

415
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,660
She likes Aravind Swamy.

416
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,790
-Who is he?
-I have no idea!

417
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,290
Heard their wishes?

418
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:17,620
Is it possible...

419
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,290
... if you hold on to this field which
has only weeds, bushes and dry coconuts?

420
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,330
Hey Ram!
Throw it at his leg.

421
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,750
Come on!

422
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,160
Throw it!

423
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,000
Come on, Ram!

424
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:32,290
Pace! Pace!
Malcolm Marshall.

425
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,540
You're finished, Abdullah!

426
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,370
We are with you, right?

427
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,120
We just need your
signature, Ikka.

428
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,370
And you needn't do it blindly.

429
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,250
We'll bring the agreement,

430
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,080
and Advocate Menon will read out
every word and every letter to you.

431
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,910
You need to sign it only if you're
satisfied after listening to it.

432
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,580
I told you, right?

433
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,910
If this sale happens,
it will benefit us too.

434
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,450
Even after all these years,
I'm still not well settled, Ikka.

435
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,450
My only house is mortgaged.

436
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:06,700
I can't afford the rent of the
house in which I'm staying now.

437
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,580
I'm sinking!

438
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,200
Neck deep in debts!

439
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,750
I need to save Ram at least.

440
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,370
How's that?

441
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,120
And then?

442
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,790
Then... nothing more!

443
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,040
Ramkumar's resort where we're headed
to now, is situated on that property.

444
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,660
When we go there with this lamp,

445
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,660
he will instantly understand that we're
going there after talking about all this.

446
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,950
He's a bloody shark!

447
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,000
So, forget whatever
I told you so far.

448
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,580
Yeah, right!

449
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,040
As if I have no other job than
remembering this flashback!

450
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,540
We're neck deep in debts.

451
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,580
I just hope Ram makes
a huge investment.

452
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,580
Then, don't ask me anything
more about the past.

453
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,580
Understood?

454
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,700
Don't tell him that we
met Adullah Marakkar.

455
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,910
You make sure that you
don't blurt it out.

456
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:27,950
Me?

457
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,160
So...

458
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,700
where are those two girls?

459
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,290
I don't know!

460
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:40,620
Where was Abdullah working?

461
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,250
He was in Mumbai.

462
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,330
He was in a mental
asylum, apparently.

463
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,580
It would be a surprise
if he didn't go crazy.

464
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,200
Tall, Latino,

465
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,830
Ebony, Dusky,

466
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:13,870
MILF...

467
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,830
These are your current favourites, right?

468
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,120
Fair enough!

469
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,870
Or rather,

470
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,040
unfair enough.

471
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,290
Psst!

472
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,910
Is this why you said that this one's
better than the resort at Southampton?

473
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,580
We don't have to give the parasailing
option to the guests here.

474
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,120
That's for sure.

475
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,410
The mosquitoes can
take them parasailing.

476
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,290
The window netting team will
come day after tomorrow.

477
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,410
I've arranged it.

478
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,790
My dear man,

479
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:49,040
our first customers are
coming this weekend.

480
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,370
It's a high profile entry.

481
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,080
I'll manage that.
You don't worry.

482
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:55,250
I have to worry
and I will worry.

483
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:01,000
Accadio looks for my signature
in the quality check documents.

484
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
Not yours.

485
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,790
Is it?

486
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:04,870
If that's the case,

487
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,830
you've taken the quotation for
the CCTV installation, right?

488
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,370
What's happening with that?

489
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,200
Isn't it part of quality check?

490
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,370
Isn't that a basic need
of a luxurious resort

491
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,750
which has relics worth at
least a millon dollars?

492
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,290
I'll get it installed.

493
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:22,040
But that will be the
least of my priorities.

494
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,830
First, you install a mosquito net.

495
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,040
I'll get the CCTV
installed after that.

496
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,500
Bloody shit!

497
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,120
Accadio Saket.

498
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,580
What must be the meaning of it?

499
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,250
Accadio is a French word.

500
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,620
Saket is a Sanskrit word.

501
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
He's quite impressive!

502
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,620
Isn't anybody around?

503
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,080
Let me check.

504
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:12,870
Hello!

505
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,620
Hello!

506
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,450
Hail Lord Ram!

507
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,500
Yes.
Ram!

508
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,620
Is he inside?

509
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,700
-He was just greeting you.
-Is it?

510
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,790
Park the car over there.

511
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,370
-Over there?
-Yes.

512
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,830
I understood what he said.

513
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,330
I was just pulling his leg.

514
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,830
You didn't get that, huh?

515
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,410
I did! You're lucky that
he didn't pull your leg!

516
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:48,910
Potty...

517
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,160
Don't take that lamp now.

518
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,540
We can ask the watchman to
bring it if required.

519
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:56,450
Hello brother!

520
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,290
Give me time for two more days.

521
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,700
I've come to Vadakara
to make an arrangement.

522
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,580
No. I'll do it.
Definitely!

523
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,120
Sorry!

524
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,290
Hello, Your Holiness!

525
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,580
-I'll call you back!
-Mr. Curd Rice!

526
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,370
Ram!

527
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,040
Long time!

528
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,950
This is my wife, Prabha.

529
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,410
-Hello.
-Hey Prabha!

530
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,580
How are you?

531
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,160
Fine.

532
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,540
-You look gorgeous.
-Thank you.

533
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,540
Don't I always tell you
to wear the Sari properly?

534
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,870
Didn't you see how
he was looking?

535
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:35,080
He's just named Ram.
He's actually a Ravan.

536
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,500
-What?
-Well...

537
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:39,370
It's quite a costly construction.

538
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,660
-Costly!
-Let that be!

539
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,620
- Is this your car?
-Yes.

540
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,080
-Pathetic!
-Why?

541
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,080
How will you impress
top-tier business clients,

542
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,950
without a premium sedan, at least?

543
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,910
You're still the
same old miser, huh?

544
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,790
What's that lamp
on the back seat?

545
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,080
We bought it for our house.

546
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,080
There's a really nice
shop in the market here.

547
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,790
-If you like it, you can take it.
-Get lost!

548
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,580
I don't allow such cheap items
even anywhere near this place.

549
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,080
Come, I wanna show
you something.

550
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,580
Welcome... .. to the Accadio Saket!

551
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,330
Thank you, dear!

552
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,450
We are the number one luxury
stay chain in the world.

553
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,950
ACS, Bechtel, Vinci and Skanska...

554
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,330
... come only after us.
- Is it?

555
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,830
We focus on sea-side properties.

556
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:23,290
We have 116 coastal home-stay
properties currently.

557
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:24,120
Superb!

558
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,250
Across the world!

559
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,700
-The sun never sets on the Accadio Saket!
-Wonderful.

560
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,040
Those who come here,

561
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,540
walk along with history,

562
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,660
breathe history,

563
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:32,830
eat along with history,

564
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,040
and sleep with history.

565
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,580
Hey! Do you know the
tariff here for one night?

566
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,000
3 Lakhs plus taxes.

567
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,000
You won't understand
all that, you Veggie!

568
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,910
It's a million dollar game!

569
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:45,950
Everything you see here...

570
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,330
... are historical relics.

571
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,620
Very very costly,

572
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,450
and specially curated
for the Accadio Saket.

573
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,580
Like our tagline suggests,

574
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,160
the guests pay us to
'Stay among the relics'.

575
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,580
Wow!

576
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,910
-Beautiful.
-Yes!

577
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,000
-These are?
-See!

578
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,080
To understand style and substance,
you need a classy eye.

579
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,250
I like that!

580
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,250
See this! This is from
Chandragupta Maurya's period.

581
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,410
We have twelve of them,
on either side of the pathway.

582
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,790
Saw that?

583
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,250
It's from Krishnadevarayar's period.

584
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,040
Come!

585
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,250
There's much more to see!

586
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,950
Wow! Hey!

587
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,830
This! This is awesome!

588
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Broken Ganesha!

589
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,120
Superb design!

590
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,870
I love modern art!

591
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,660
This is true art!

592
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,370
Must be imported
from America, right?

593
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,290
Get lost.
This is not modern art!

594
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,330
Hey Pawan!

595
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,290
-Pawan!
-Yes, sir!

596
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,950
Take this away!

597
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,620
Put it in the basket and
keep it on your head.

598
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,160
I was going to throw it, sir.

599
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,120
-What?
-I was going to throw it.

600
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:42,000
Then go and throw it, you ass!

601
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,040
You come!
Bloody Ganesh Visarjan!

602
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,290
Now it's here too!

603
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:48,370
Its hands, head, trunk,
rat, Laddoos and what not,

604
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:50,200
are lying all over
my private beach.

605
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:52,540
I asked him to throw it away
and he has kept it here.

606
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,620
*******!

607
00:33:58,910 --> 00:33:59,910
Come!

608
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,250
-Ram, should I remove my shoes?
-No, come.

609
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,540
What is this?
A museum?

610
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,750
Hey! Here's our guest for the night.

611
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:11,660
-Hello!
-Hi!

612
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,330
-Parameshwaran Potty, right?
-Yes.

613
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:14,660
Potty, this is Mythili.

614
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:15,870
This is his wife, err...

615
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,290
Prabha!

616
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,000
Can you please take them around?

617
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,790
-I'll take this call and come.
-Sure.

618
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,830
Hello!

619
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,910
Please come.
You can see the interiors.

620
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:27,290
Mythili... this?

621
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,870
The Greek Thinker.

622
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,660
It's the only other
replica of the thinker.

623
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:33,120
This is from Accadio's
original collection.

624
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,330
Okay.

625
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:36,750
Everything else was
procured by us at Saket.

626
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:40,080
These relics are Accadio Saket's USP.

627
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,790
Our priceless relics gallery.

628
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,120
Incidentally,

629
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,330
this is the Accadio-Saket
partnership's vanguard property.

630
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,370
Oh, I see!

631
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:48,660
Yeah, yeah!
I'll meet them.

632
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:49,910
-Come.
-Yeah, sure.

633
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,120
Now I'll show them around.

634
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,580
You may please go and...

635
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,830
... get something to drink.

636
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,500
-Come.
-Hey Ram!

637
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:59,450
This one?

638
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,620
This is...

639
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,080
This is Hitler, right?

640
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,660
Yes.
Made in wax!

641
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,580
Who's this bald head?

642
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:11,870
Benito Mussolini.

643
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,410
These guys had killed
a lot of people, right?

644
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,290
Hey! It's a really bad omen...

645
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:20,120
... to place these guys at the entrance.
-What do you even know?

646
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,620
-Have you heard their speeches?
-Yeah, right!

647
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,250
"Bhaiyon aur Behanon"

648
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,750
No one can beat that!

649
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:26,910
Get lost!

650
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:27,950
-I'm sorry.
-Come.

651
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:31,950
Mahatma Gandhiji.

652
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,700
Hey! Aren't these Gandhiji's spectacles?

653
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:38,000
Yes! I bought it
during an action....

654
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,040
... for 350,000 Dollars.
-Oh!

655
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,580
This is an ancient statue.

656
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,500
An extremely rare piece of art.

657
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,950
Wow!
Che Guvera!

658
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,870
What's this vanity
bag doing here?

659
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,330
It's a backpack he used
when he was in Bolivia.

660
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,250
I bought it when I got
it for a good price.

661
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,950
Just 250,000 Dollars.

662
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Wow!

663
00:35:58,830 --> 00:35:59,870
Safdar Hashmi.

664
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,580
There's a lot to say about him.

665
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,250
But this is the pen he used,
while he was working in Economic Times.

666
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:06,540
A very valuable piece!

667
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,120
This is awesome!
This is a great omen!

668
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,040
You should be keeping
this at your entrance!

669
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,870
Lord Krishna!
Bless me!

670
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:18,450
You idiot!
This is not Lord Krishna!

671
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,290
This is NTR.
NT Rama Rao.

672
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:23,200
This is a famous character he played.

673
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,750
He became the Chief Minister
twice in Andhra, doing all this.

674
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,750
You are too much!

675
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:29,700
-So he was a Chief Minister too?
-No! Panchayat President!

676
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,120
Hey! Don't touch that!

677
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,830
-Don't touch!
-I won't.

678
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,290
These are all antiques from Africa,
that are worth several Lakhs.

679
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,370
-If they fall..
- What's this?

680
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,370
Hey! No!

681
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,450
It's just an extension.

682
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,040
-Come.
-Keep a distance from him.

683
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,500
The coin used by THE Amitabh Bachchan
in the movie, Sholay.

684
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,370
You've seen it only
in the movie, right?

685
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,370
In real!

686
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:51,080
The dagger used by Jhansi Rani,
to kill the British.

687
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,370
This is it.

688
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,790
This is my hero!

689
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,330
Can you say who it is?

690
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:01,790
Who is it?

691
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,370
-Stalin!
-Oh yeah!

692
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,450
Karunanidhi's son!

693
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,080
You...

694
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:09,580
How do you run a company without
a minimum general knowledge?

695
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:14,450
And this is the legendary
Dhyan Chand Singh's hockey stick.

696
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,160
Wow! Cricket bat!

697
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:22,330
Hey! This is the bat with which
Kapil Dev scored 175 not out,

698
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:24,580
against Zimbabwe in the
Prudential Cup, 1983.

699
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,370
Phew! You know at least that, huh?

700
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,450
-Did you tell him anything?
-No.

701
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,250
See! We won't get a chance after this.
I have to go back.

702
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:35,000
-Please!
-I don't know!

703
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
I will tell him.
But you have to...

704
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,500
What game is this?

705
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,160
What?

706
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:43,120
This is a game played
by the Americans, right?

707
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,000
That?
It's baseball, you idiot.

708
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,450
Sundown, guests!

709
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,370
-Let there be light!
-It's sunset.

710
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,370
I'll show you our night mode now.

711
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,080
Wow!

712
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,160
Peter Hofer.

713
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,660
Special... double barrel gun?

714
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:30,370
Ram... 224,000 Dollars?

715
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:31,830
Really?

716
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,870
This is an isolated place, right?

717
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,080
I bought it for self-protection.

718
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,450
It's part of my personal collection.

719
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,750
Hey! It's fully loaded.

720
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:43,950
Don't play with it.

721
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,410
Idiot!

722
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:48,540
You carry on.

723
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,120
We're currently a partnership
company incorporated in 2014,

724
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,410
...based in Trivandrum.
-Yeah, fine.

725
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,580
We have an annual turnover of
1 Crore in the last three years.

726
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,250
Dude, do you remember...

727
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,870
...Uncle Basheer's
Tipu Sultan gun?

728
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,200
But it was smaller
than this one, right?

729
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
That reminds me!

730
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,450
I forgot to show you someone.

731
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,500
Come!
One second.

732
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Cheers!

733
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,370
Come.

734
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,080
-Hello guests.
-Oh my God!

735
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,080
My name is Anastasia Aubert.

736
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:48,580
and I am the founder, initiator
of the Accadio homestay network.

737
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,500
It's a hologram.

738
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,290
One of the world's largest luxury..

739
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,580
Oh my God!

740
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:55,040
This is the old white lady
who came that day, right?

741
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:56,950
What is this, man?

742
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,000
The same hairstyle.

743
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,120
The same frock.

744
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,700
The same stance.

745
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:04,410
Oh my God!

746
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,790
Hey! You haven't
changed at all, huh?

747
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,410
You're still that
old country bumpkin!

748
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,830
-Goodbye. Au revoir.
-Wait.

749
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,700
Look at this.

750
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,700
This is the Accadio Saket fun room.

751
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,870
You can see many
wonders like this here.

752
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,620
Come, let's talk serious business now.

753
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
So that's the plan.

754
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,700
A profitable revamp of your software setup,

755
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,910
with clientele predominantly in the U.S.,

756
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:39,700
Germany and U.K.

757
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,910
-Yes.
-Precisely, Ram.

758
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,330
I'll tell you something frankly.

759
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,040
My business has grown so much...

760
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,250
... because of my shrewdness.

761
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,580
Of course,
Mythili's money back-up too.

762
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,040
Coming back to our point.

763
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,200
What is your qualification
to run this business?

764
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,410
I have studied B.Com.

765
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,830
And I've done MBA too.

766
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:04,790
You're referring to the degree from
some cheap college in Nagercoil as MBA?

767
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,540
There's no M, B or A there.
So, forget that.

768
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:08,870
Then...

769
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,870
I've noticed it whenever
I chat with you.

770
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,580
Your English is abysmally poor.

771
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,160
Have your drink.

772
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,250
Brahmand Solutions.

773
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,580
-Who named it?
-Me.

774
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,700
I knew it.

775
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,910
You should change this
disgusting name first.

776
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,790
There's a way to do all this.

777
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,540
Anyway, forget it now.

778
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,500
I'll suggest a name.

779
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,330
Bram Solutions!

780
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:40,700
-But Brahma..
-Splendid!

781
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,000
Wow!
Thank you.

782
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,830
By the way, who among you is
planning to be the CEO?

783
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:47,870
Me.

784
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,410
What a successful
CEO needs the most,

785
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:56,120
is an impressive command
over two European languages,

786
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,160
other than English.

787
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,370
And last but not the least,

788
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:01,290
a rock solid personality!

789
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,700
Don't get me wrong, Potty.

790
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,200
You don't have any of this.

791
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:09,910
If so,

792
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:13,700
the most worthless person on this earth,
would be Stephen Hawking.

793
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,120
He's a scientist, damn it!

794
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:17,910
Let's start with his name!

795
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:19,540
Parameshwaran Potty.

796
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,080
How do you spell it in English?

797
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,750
P-O-T-T-Y.

798
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:25,330
Just like I thought!

799
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:29,450
Dude, 'Potty' has two
meanings in English.

800
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:30,830
One.

801
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:32,540
The thing in which
children take a shit.

802
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:34,830
Two.

803
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:35,870
An imbecile.

804
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,250
I'm serious!

805
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,080
Moreover,

806
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,700
westerners never prefer...

807
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,120
... open ending names which end
with sounds like 'E' and 'Oo'.

808
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,200
Ramkumar, Mythili Ram.

809
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,950
Short and pronounceable.

810
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,290
What's your full name, Prabha?

811
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,580
Prabha Nair.

812
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,080
-Are you a Nair?
-Yes.

813
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,330
-Wow!
-There are exceptions even among that.

814
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,790
Narayana Swamy, Sundar Pichai,
Ambani, Adani...

815
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,290
These are all 'E's and 'Oo's, right?

816
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:03,410
We're talking about the CEO
of a software company now.

817
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,040
A company which I am
supposed to be investing in.

818
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,250
If I don't have confidence,
I won't invest.

819
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:12,160
Be it a friend, colleague or even
my father. That's what I'll do.

820
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,080
Talking of your
father reminds me...

821
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:17,830
When your father got the documents
of this property written in his name,

822
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:19,040
from our old Uncle Basheer...

823
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:22,250
He didn't think of continents
or confidence like this.

824
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:24,080
Not continents.
Countenance!

825
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,410
Well, I was just saying.

826
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:27,620
Mythili, if I tell you about
what happened back then,

827
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,540
I can't imagine what
will happen here.

828
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:32,290
It will be a floccinaucinihilipilification.

829
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,660
What?

830
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:36,750
He has been listening to Shashi Tharoor's
speeches all the time lately,

831
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,410
to improve his English.

832
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,790
Uncle Basheer?

833
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,290
Does this place
have such a history?

834
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,160
You didn't tell me.

835
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,330
Who's this Basheer?

836
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:51,200
Well, this 'Sanket' of yours?

837
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,290
-Saket!
-Yes, whatever.

838
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:55,200
-Long before this came into being.
-Shucks!

839
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:56,450
Those are all old stories!

840
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,540
Forget all that, Potty.

841
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,330
Please don't subvert the topic.

842
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:00,700
I was saying that...

843
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:02,250
I am ready to help you.

844
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,040
But I'm not ready to
forget my profit motive.

845
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,750
I'm a businessman.
That's all.

846
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:07,830
Hey Mythili...

847
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,580
Back in the day, he cleared his
exams from 4th to 10th grade,

848
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:13,000
copying my notes
and answer sheets.

849
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,540
-There's not doubt about that anyway!
-See!

850
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:16,910
It's not 'not doubt'.

851
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,290
-'No doubt'!
-Didn't I say so?

852
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:19,330
No!

853
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,700
If you have a doubt,
ask Prabha.

854
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,620
You said 'not doubt'.

855
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:26,950
Have your drink.

856
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:28,410
I will drink.

857
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:31,750
I'll do one thing.

858
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,080
I'll bring some snacks.

859
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,120
You guys talk.

860
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:49,330
I will invest...

861
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,620
... on one condition.

862
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:53,000
Prabha should be the CEO.

863
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:54,950
She's elegant,

864
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,160
articulate,

865
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,160
and good looking.

866
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:58,620
What say?

867
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:17,450
What is this?

868
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,160
I'm asking you!

869
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:21,620
Go hunting!

870
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,120
But even that has some ethics.

871
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:24,950
You need to have that.

872
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,080
Is your childhood friend's wife
your next target?

873
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,450
We owe 2.5 Crores to the bank.

874
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,580
Our house and office are
facing a seizure notice.

875
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:38,500
Ram is offering us 3 Crores
without charging any interest.

876
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,700
We don't have any other option.

877
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:44,080
So, please don't create
an unnecessary scene here.

878
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,500
I know he is flirting with me.

879
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:49,540
I know how to manage that.

880
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:53,750
That's all you have left to do.

881
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,160
Go ahead!
Get drunk!

882
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:03,250
When you went on a
solo trip to Amsterdam,

883
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,660
did I ask you who the
playboy with you was?

884
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:06,870
No.

885
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:09,370
When you were at Norway countryside
for two months with a Negro...

886
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:10,410
Oh! Sorry!

887
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:11,700
That's politically incorrect.

888
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,040
You stayed with a 'man of
colour' for two months.

889
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,540
Did I ask you anything?
No!

890
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,950
So I will do whatever I
want with my friend's wife,

891
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,830
or with my aunt's daughter!

892
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:22,330
Can you ask anything?

893
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:23,790
No!

894
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:25,870
So just shut your mouth up!

895
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:29,620
These are the privileges
of being affluent and rich!

896
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:32,250
Please enjoy it... and
let others also enjoy.

897
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:33,700
Okay?

898
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,580
I can't tolerate this.

899
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:47,910
Do whatever you want!

900
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:54,950
Err.. Toilet?

901
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:57,540
Over there... in the fun room.

902
00:46:58,540 --> 00:46:59,540
Potty...

903
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:03,790
I'm sorry.

904
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,160
You bloody son of a gun, Potty!

905
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,910
In the name of saving your business,

906
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,250
you took Rs. 75 Lakhs from
me and screwed me over!

907
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,370
No capital, no interest either!

908
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:10,540
Can't you just pimp your
wife instead, you scumbag?

909
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:11,540
Hey Potty!

910
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,370
It's me, Abdu.

911
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:17,080
I don't have any
issue with you, dude!

912
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:21,660
I know that your dad, the High Priest,
had a part to play in this betrayal!

913
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:25,870
But I can forgive that, since it was
just a hapless Priest's desperation...

914
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,790
...resulting in unintended evil.

915
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,950
My issue is with the other guy!

916
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:33,950
That bloody son of a gun, Ram.

917
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,080
I want to see him.

918
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,370
But... not to give him a hug.

919
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:42,450
You heard me?

920
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:43,910
See you sometime!

921
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,160
This is my number.

922
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,870
You can save it,
if you really want to!

923
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,410
Mythili, where is Prabha?

924
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:06,870
Upstairs, with Ram.

925
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:07,950
Upstairs?

926
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,790
-Come, sit.
-No, it's okay.

927
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:11,330
How do I go upstairs?

928
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:12,870
End of the hall, at the left,
you'll see the staircase.

929
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:13,540
That way?

930
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:14,580
-Yes.
-Okay.

931
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:02,580
Another one!

932
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:04,040
Sex is also like money.

933
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:06,000
Only too much is enough!

934
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:08,160
And even when it's bad,

935
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,200
it's good!

936
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:13,830
Hey Potty!

937
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,500
Come!

938
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:21,700
Look!
The night sea!

939
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:23,500
It's a magnificent view from here.

940
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:25,500
Enjoy the view.
I'll make a call and come.

941
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,620
Okay?

942
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:35,200
You knew him already, right?

943
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:36,580
What is this, Potty?

944
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,200
He is a business
development consultant.

945
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:42,330
A leading venture capitalist, as well.

946
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:46,330
We've been chatting
for the past two years...

947
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:47,790
... on Instagram.

948
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,830
Did you think he'll contact
you out of the blue?

949
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:55,910
Has Ram called you
in the past 12 years?

950
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,200
So...

951
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:00,040
did he chat with me,
because you told him to?

952
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,450
Did he invite me because
you asked him to?

953
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,500
Yes!

954
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,450
But I know where to draw the line.

955
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:08,660
You don't worry.

956
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:15,580
Dog!

957
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:35,290
You didn't expect me to be
here with Ram, right Prabha?

958
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:37,830
No, nothing like that.

959
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:40,500
Don't be apologetic.

960
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:41,580
It's okay.

961
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:44,540
I'm used to this,
since maybe ten years.

962
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,080
I'm over all that silly stuff.

963
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,290
We are just business partners.

964
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:51,290
This marriage is just a...

965
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:53,580
... working arrangement.

966
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:57,290
This nuptial chain...
is only for people.

967
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,080
-Cut this, Pawan.
-Okay, Madam.

968
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:02,620
About our business...

969
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:04,370
You know,

970
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:06,080
we are in dire straits.

971
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,330
I'm... desperate.

972
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:09,660
Prabha...

973
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,120
You don't have to explain to me.

974
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,540
He is a complete womanizer.

975
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,910
And... that's the only
way to get to him.

976
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:20,910
This thing called guilt...
If you remove that from your mind,

977
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:23,040
life becomes extremely smooth.

978
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,700
After all, it's a man-made thing.

979
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:27,620
Or is it woman-made?

980
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:30,830
Do you need any help here?

981
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:32,410
No, no.
Just help yourself.

982
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:34,910
Life in here... is a buffet.

983
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:36,580
Here!

984
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:44,250
So that's me...

985
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,700
investing 3 Crores...

986
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,080
... to Brahmand.

987
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,910
It will be renamed to 'Bram' Solutions.

988
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:51,290
Okay.

989
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,370
And here... is Prabha Nair,

990
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:55,080
the C-E-O.

991
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:57,370
And regarding the reporting system,

992
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:58,620
I'll come to that later.

993
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:00,410
Okay.

994
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:02,870
First of all, you need
a complete makeover.

995
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,950
You have to look sexy
and stylish, you know?

996
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:07,120
-Oh!
-Get rid of this Sari...

997
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:08,870
and try western outfits.

998
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:11,120
You have a lovely complexion.

999
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,580
-You'd look superb.
-Thank you.

1000
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:13,790
I'll take you out shopping.

1001
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:17,540
The first thing you should do...
is to get a residence Visa in the UAE.

1002
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,700
I'll get that done...
and you can stay with us.

1003
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:21,330
-Okay.
-And...

1004
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:24,250
you should open a bank account at
the Hinduja or Lombard over there.

1005
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:26,910
I'll be transferring the money
from my Swiss bank account...

1006
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:28,040
to this new account of yours.

1007
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:29,910
Don't worry about anything.

1008
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,000
I'll take care of all the nitty-gritties.

1009
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,660
-Yeah?
-Oh! Thank you!

1010
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:35,790
Good!

1011
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,700
Which one did you
like among these?

1012
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,910
These two are nice.

1013
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:15,950
Forget this one.

1014
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,620
Ram has already booked this one.

1015
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:18,870
You can take this one.

1016
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:27,000
-How's this?
-Arabic attire?

1017
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,370
-This is great.
-Do you want it?

1018
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:30,160
-No, I don't want it.
-Still...

1019
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,870
-Wear it once for me.
-No, dude.

1020
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,200
-Wear it.
-No, dude!

1021
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:35,250
You wear it!

1022
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:43,120
Shouldn't you be very careful while
selling your property, Basheer?

1023
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,370
And it's a property that has been around
since the time of the great Marakkar.

1024
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:52,080
Even if you want to buy a similar house
and property at such a prime location,

1025
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,410
can you manage it now?

1026
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:58,830
Only God knows how the times
are going to change, hereafter.

1027
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,040
Are you upset that this
property is being sold..,

1028
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,080
...or the fact that I am
selling it to Hindus?

1029
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:05,500
Why are you feigning ignorance, Ikka?

1030
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:07,500
Are you not aware of
what's happening around us?

1031
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,450
The problem is precisely that
you're selling it to the Kafirs.

1032
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:11,250
I'll tell you something.

1033
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:12,750
I came along with the Musaliyar,

1034
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:15,750
after finding a buyer from our faith
for your property.

1035
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,500
Two businessmen from
Manjeri are ready.

1036
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:20,120
They will pay
good money too.

1037
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,160
Money is not my only
consideration, Rahman.

1038
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:23,700
What else is your consideration?

1039
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:25,910
Musaliyar...

1040
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,370
This Nair and Menon
are like blood brothers to me.

1041
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,290
When they are asking me
something out of sheer need,

1042
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:36,450
it would be unfair on my part to
refuse them on grounds of religion..,

1043
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,080
...and sell it to someone of our faith.

1044
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:40,910
I won't do that.

1045
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:42,700
That does not befit
men of honour like us.

1046
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:44,870
You don't have to
lecture us about honour.

1047
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,250
Don't you know that they have
killed thousands of our brothers?

1048
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:50,910
Or... are you acting like
you're unaware of it?

1049
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,950
We should preserve at
least the land we own.

1050
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:59,330
Otherwise, they will turn us into
outsiders in our own land, soon enough.

1051
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:01,620
Rahman!
That's enough! Stop it.

1052
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:06,250
I'm not giving you a befitting reply,
just because you're at my house.

1053
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:08,410
How old are you, boy?

1054
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:09,750
Tell me.

1055
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:13,450
I know this land and the people here,
much more than you do.

1056
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:15,700
You don't have to
teach me all that.

1057
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,370
Musaliyar, please explain all this to him,
when you have the time.

1058
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:24,450
It is such hateful thinking that
creates big problems.

1059
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,790
Only if the people help each
other to grow and reform,

1060
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:31,540
will this land stay alive!

1061
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:35,580
Learn to love this country and
obey the law of this land, first.

1062
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,080
Everything else will
become alright on its own.

1063
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,370
No wonder you don't have a
prayer bump on your forehead.

1064
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:42,870
Prayer bump, huh?

1065
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,410
There are Muslims here,
who pray five times a day,

1066
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,700
and still don't
have a prayer bump.

1067
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:49,250
It's just that you
haven't seen such people.

1068
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:50,290
So don't tell me that.

1069
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:53,330
Musaliyar... you don't have to worry.

1070
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:55,750
I'm not selling the entire property.

1071
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:58,950
Just those four acres by the beach.

1072
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:02,200
The rest of the property and
this house will still be with me.

1073
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:06,870
Now, don't be upset.
Drink the juice, lad!

1074
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:10,160
Mom, look at Potty!
How does he look?

1075
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:14,040
Abdu, don't make him play
the fool. Take it off!

1076
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,290
Why? He looks really good!

1077
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:18,040
"Sheikh Potty Bin Melshanthi"!

1078
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,290
Sahib...

1079
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:22,330
The High Priest is here.

1080
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:24,790
-Is it time to take him back home?
-Yes.

1081
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:26,080
Abdu!

1082
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:28,500
Potty's father is
here to take him back.

1083
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:29,660
Bring him here.

1084
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,450
Come on, Sheikh Potty.

1085
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:32,750
Hey! Hey!

1086
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:34,200
Behave yourself!

1087
00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:36,120
Why are you standing
there, Potty? Have a seat.

1088
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,080
Dad, look at him!

1089
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,290
Sheikh Potty.

1090
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:49,660
What the hell are you doing, Abdu?

1091
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,080
Don't you dare play mischief
with anything and anyone.

1092
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,620
Go inside and take it off, son.

1093
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:55,120
Go.

1094
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,370
Please don't mind it, Priest.

1095
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:01,290
You know my son, right?

1096
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:02,410
Please don't bother.

1097
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:04,200
They are children,
it's natural.

1098
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:18,000
I don't send you here so that you can
dress up like a fool and humiliate me!

1099
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,790
That boy can't write
notes by himself or what?

1100
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:24,370
Should you go over
and help him everyday?

1101
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:27,370
They are uncivilized people.
Don't forget that.

1102
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:29,250
Show me your hand.

1103
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:32,950
Don't eat whatever
they give you.

1104
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:35,250
What is this?

1105
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,580
This is a dress
that Abdu gave me.

1106
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:40,540
Come on, walk!
Ass!

1107
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,040
Come on!

1108
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:46,620
Potty!

1109
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:48,000
You just want to stand here?
Come!

1110
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,450
I'll show you a great state-of-the-art
home theatre. Come on!

1111
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:51,830
Come, dude!

1112
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,750
Prabha! Hey!

1113
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,120
Look!

1114
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:04,620
It's an 8K projection.

1115
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,200
You can watch movies, TV channels...

1116
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:09,410
Moreover, you can even watch
porn in a theatre effect.

1117
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,200
Come, I'll show you.

1118
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:18,500
Sit down, man!

1119
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,200
What do you want to watch?

1120
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:21,540
Horror?

1121
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:22,660
Comedy?

1122
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:23,700
Action?

1123
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:24,750
Or....?

1124
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:28,370
Let's start.

1125
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:31,410
Hey Potty!

1126
01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:33,870
Your favourite actor
is still Rajinikanth, right?

1127
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:36,540
Come on.

1128
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:39,370
Annamalai is not available.

1129
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:41,500
I can't find Baasha.

1130
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:43,290
'Muthu'.
Is 'Muthu' okay?

1131
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:44,750
Yes, 'Muthu' is fine.
Play it.

1132
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,370
-Go forward.
-Huh?

1133
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:48,700
Fast forward!

1134
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,540
Some more.

1135
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:53,250
Some more.

1136
01:01:55,830 --> 01:01:56,870
Yes, stop here.

1137
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:58,250
Play it.

1138
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:07,700
Pause!

1139
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:08,750
Pause, pause!

1140
01:02:11,410 --> 01:02:14,910
Raghuvaran usurped the father Rajinikanth's
properties, using forged documents.

1141
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:17,410
The son Rajinikanth was a child then.

1142
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,290
But Raghuvaran is up for a shock.

1143
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:22,830
The father Rajinikanth
will forgive Raghuvaran.

1144
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,620
Out of that depression,

1145
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:25,950
Raghuvaran will commit suicide.

1146
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:29,330
A similar story has happened right here,
in this property too.

1147
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,620
But the one who committed suicide,
was not the betrayer.

1148
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,450
It was the betrayed.

1149
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:40,500
That Abdullah?

1150
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:41,750
Where is he now?

1151
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:43,250
Who knows!

1152
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:45,200
He fled from this
town long ago, right?

1153
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:48,080
What about his sisters?

1154
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:51,000
I saw it on a school WhatsApp
group which I was part of, earlier.

1155
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:52,830
That the two of them are
somewhere in Syria, apparently.

1156
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:55,540
But only God knows
who they are with,

1157
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:57,750
and what condition they are in.

1158
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,370
That country is going through
a revolt and war, right?

1159
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:02,790
Well, you should be knowing
about all this first.

1160
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:07,830
You can see news
channels also on this.

1161
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,080
Where's Mythili?

1162
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:12,700
Let me go downstairs.

1163
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,250
You're spoiling it.
Idiot!

1164
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:18,250
There are several reports about the
increasing crime rates in this city, sir.

1165
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:19,870
Is it because of the
indifference of the police?

1166
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:21,580
What do you have
to say about this?

1167
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:22,910
Ever since I took charge here,

1168
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:24,660
law and order issues have
dropped considerably.

1169
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,040
I can show you the statistics.

1170
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,080
Isn't this our Kalyanam?

1171
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,700
Hey! Don't call him that.

1172
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:30,870
Kalyan!
That's his name.

1173
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:32,660
Wait.

1174
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,700
I was going to give you a surprise.

1175
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:42,200
He is the proxy fund manager
of Accadio Saket in Kerala.

1176
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:43,790
Women's safety, child safety...

1177
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:46,910
Police have undertaken large scale
surveillance measures in these fronts.

1178
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:48,450
He's a silent partner
of all this too.

1179
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:50,500
-He's a DIG in the police.
-I've heard that.

1180
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,500
And the surprise is that...

1181
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:56,620
...he is coming here.

1182
01:03:56,830 --> 01:03:57,830
In some time.

1183
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:01,330
It's good to have a police
connection in your business too.

1184
01:04:01,790 --> 01:04:03,000
You talk to him.

1185
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:04,950
You can stay here
and leave tomorrow.

1186
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:07,160
After dinner,

1187
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,200
I need to have some deep
discussions with Prabha.

1188
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:12,120
Even if I go back to Southampton,
Prabha will have to come there.

1189
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,660
I'll be signing the
papers over there.

1190
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:17,660
Hey Potty!

1191
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,910
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

1192
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:21,330
You got me, right?

1193
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:29,250
-What?
-Sir, a man is here.

1194
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:30,290
Who?

1195
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:31,950
Who are you?
Sir wants to know.

1196
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:33,830
Sir, he's saying that
he's your friend.

1197
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,330
Hey! Kalyan Menon is here.

1198
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:36,450
Send him in.

1199
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:37,660
Okay.
You may go inside.

1200
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,500
Hey Kalyan!

1201
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:43,910
Where is my friend?

1202
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:45,540
He went to the backside, sir.

1203
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:46,870
Backside?
Why?

1204
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:48,790
How do I know, sir?

1205
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:50,330
Come, let's go and check.

1206
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:52,370
Kalyan!

1207
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,160
Who is this?

1208
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:04,910
Who is this?

1209
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Father!

1210
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,160
Yes!

1211
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:17,370
What is it, son?

1212
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,250
Are you fine, father?

1213
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,040
Of course!

1214
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:23,790
We lost everything!

1215
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:26,950
And yet you are fine?

1216
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:34,790
That's right, father.

1217
01:05:40,790 --> 01:05:42,290
Heard what my father said?

1218
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:46,370
"So what if we lost the house, son...

1219
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:50,540
They have built us a
Jannat-Ul-Firdaus here!"

1220
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,330
Abdullah Marakkar.

1221
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:54,950
How did he reach here?

1222
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,950
The house that Ram built...

1223
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:03,290
... is just like you
building a house for me.

1224
01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:04,950
Abdu...

1225
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:17,080
We lost everything, son.

1226
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:19,620
Everything!

1227
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,290
We lost your father too!

1228
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:37,290
Abdu...

1229
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,200
Mother!

1230
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,910
Aishu had called
me over the phone.

1231
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:48,200
She told me that...

1232
01:06:48,410 --> 01:06:51,040
she will be going to the city,

1233
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,500
with her husband.

1234
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:54,910
We need to find where they are.

1235
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:58,500
We need to find who took her.

1236
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,750
Promise me, son.

1237
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:04,120
Promise your mother.

1238
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:07,120
The promise of a madman...

1239
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,330
What value does it have, mother?

1240
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:20,500
Mother!

1241
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:40,250
Two women among the 174 people who
died in the bomb attack at Syria...

1242
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:42,410
I heard that they were
Beevuamma's daughters.

1243
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,290
We didn't tell her that
because she was ailing.

1244
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:54,370
Aisha!

1245
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:56,750
Rehana!

1246
01:07:57,870 --> 01:07:59,080
Aisha!

1247
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:01,790
Rehana!

1248
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,290
Brother...

1249
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:17,950
Save us from here, brother!

1250
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:23,000
Save us, brother!

1251
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:26,080
Brother...

1252
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:28,000
Brother!

1253
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:33,910
Here stood almost 500 years ago,

1254
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:37,200
an original structure
built by successors...

1255
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,660
... of the great Naval captain of Kerala,

1256
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:40,910
Kunjali, the Third,

1257
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:43,370
also known as Kunjali Marakkar.

1258
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:55,660
Hey Potty!

1259
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:57,540
Your Holiness,
do you want to bowl?

1260
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:59,290
Go and be the Umpire,
you ass!

1261
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,500
I will bowl...!

1262
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:03,080
Pace! Pace!

1263
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:05,700
Malcolm Marshall..!!
You are finished, Abdullah!

1264
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:14,830
When you destroy something,

1265
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:18,410
you should destroy it completely.

1266
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:34,870
-Ramakumara!
-Abdu, no!

1267
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,080
-Hey!

1268
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:42,750
Louder!

1269
01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:46,830
You should scream
a little louder!

1270
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,410
No one will hear it even then.

1271
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:53,620
Though he's rich and famous now,

1272
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:54,870
Abdu, please.

1273
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:59,540
there's no sign of a human here
to respond to a scream here.

1274
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:05,330
So, if this Abdu decides to take revenge
for everything that happened in the past,

1275
01:11:06,790 --> 01:11:09,910
there's no one here to say
it to the outside world.

1276
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:11,450
Right?

1277
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:15,450
Will you say it?

1278
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,450
Abdu, no!
Let go of him.

1279
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:21,540
Abdu, please.

1280
01:11:22,910 --> 01:11:24,830
The way you've caught me now...

1281
01:11:25,450 --> 01:11:27,080
Is it for me to kill him...

1282
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,540
or not to kill him?
-To kill him. I mean, not to kill him.

1283
01:11:29,950 --> 01:11:31,250
Abdu, please.

1284
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:32,790
Got scared?

1285
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
"Your Holiness!"

1286
01:11:34,410 --> 01:11:35,450
I was kidding!

1287
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:36,700
It's just a show.

1288
01:11:36,950 --> 01:11:38,450
But you....!!

1289
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:41,910
You should be scared.

1290
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:45,580
Because this is Abdu's night.

1291
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:49,200
Do you have a doubt?

1292
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:56,910
Look!

1293
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:02,870
Sir! Don't look at the moon today.

1294
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:04,620
It's the Ganesh Chathurthi festival today.

1295
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:05,660
You will be cursed.

1296
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:09,120
Who are you, you little devil?

1297
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:10,620
Bhede.

1298
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,250
Pawanputra Bhede.

1299
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:15,080
Pawanputra Bhede?

1300
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:18,370
Come on!

1301
01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:21,370
Let's talk!

1302
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:29,910
I've kept everything ready, Madam.

1303
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,910
This is Pulao, this is Paratha...

1304
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:33,700
This is Aloo Gobi and
this is Matar Paneer.

1305
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:35,250
-Okay.
-Call me if there's anything.

1306
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:38,370
Is it okay if I stay over tonight
with my uncle and friends,

1307
01:12:38,410 --> 01:12:40,080
and come back tomorrow
afternoon, Madam?

1308
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,410
Hail Lord Ram!

1309
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:42,580
Hail Lord Ram!

1310
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:45,330
Mythili...

1311
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,790
Why is he dressed like this?

1312
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,750
He's a member of Kothadia's party.

1313
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:50,660
Let him go.
That's better.

1314
01:12:58,410 --> 01:12:59,870
Sir, I'm talking about the rules.

1315
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:04,910
I gave them
permission because...

1316
01:13:04,910 --> 01:13:08,160
...they had promised that not one
person more than thousand people...

1317
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,290
...will be there at the grounds
to listen to his speech.

1318
01:13:10,290 --> 01:13:12,660
But sir, I had already informed you, right?

1319
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:15,290
Sir, more than 400 of his supporters
from different states...

1320
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:19,120
...have been staying in different
hotels here for the past one week.

1321
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,370
How many people are
attending this meeting?

1322
01:13:20,450 --> 01:13:21,750
Already 2000 plus, sir.

1323
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:23,330
There's full media coverage too.

1324
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:25,620
Almost all the COVID protocols
have been flouted, sir.

1325
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:27,250
In that case, you should
have taken a call.

1326
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:28,700
You're the Commissioner
of this city, right?

1327
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:29,910
Who is in charge there now?

1328
01:13:29,950 --> 01:13:31,580
2 ACP's, 4 CI's....

1329
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:34,540
and almost more than a hundred
constables are there at the spot, sir.

1330
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:35,790
In that case,

1331
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:38,750
we have to think of
something more effective.

1332
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:41,450
Revel among relics,
live in history.

1333
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:43,790
This is good.

1334
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:47,250
It's good to have the company of at
least one thief who's bigger than you.

1335
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:51,540
Oh! Wow!

1336
01:13:52,290 --> 01:13:54,040
-Did you call?
-Yes. The cops will come now.

1337
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:02,370
Saddam Hussein's
favourite brand of wine.

1338
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:03,700
Woah!

1339
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:07,330
I must try this drink, Ram!

1340
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:14,910
Yuck!

1341
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:17,080
Stale black tea!

1342
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,660
So everything here is fake, right?

1343
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:27,910
Deception during betrayal..!

1344
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:30,660
Catch it!

1345
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Oh no!

1346
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,200
You're impressive, Ram!

1347
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:39,750
You've kept your old cunningness intact.

1348
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:48,120
Bloody shit!

1349
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,330
Accadio Sanctum.

1350
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:54,500
Accadio believes in
preserving origins.

1351
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:57,370
Hey! It's just an extension. Let's
go there and talk peacefully.

1352
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:58,660
"Awake!

1353
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:01,540
For morning in the bowl of night...

1354
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:05,250
...has flung the stone that
puts the stars to flight."

1355
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:06,330
Abdu, no!

1356
01:15:06,330 --> 01:15:09,330
"And lo, the hunter of
the east has caught..."

1357
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:31,250
,

1358
01:16:35,950 --> 01:16:39,790
After destroying history, under the
false pretence of preserving history,

1359
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:43,330
after taking a foundation brick from
the remains of that destroyed history,

1360
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:47,250
after placing that stone in a
prayer room covered in green,

1361
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:49,830
and after posting a pseudo
historic caption below it,

1362
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,040
you invite the students of
history from lands afar,

1363
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,370
...hoodwink them, rob them of their
precious money...

1364
01:16:55,370 --> 01:16:57,080
...to lead this
luxurious life of yours!

1365
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:01,750
Hats off....

1366
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:03,290
Ram!

1367
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:07,500
When I see all this,
as a bosom friend of yours,

1368
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:09,450
I can ideally react...
in two ways:

1369
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:10,750
Either,

1370
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:13,330
be proud of the fact that
you are still nurturing

1371
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:15,950
your old ancestral skill of
living off betraying others,

1372
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:18,450
be proud that it still has been a
profitable proposition for you,

1373
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:21,500
and be proud that you have
become a great success in life.

1374
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:24,790
I can gatecrash here, celebrate
your success with a drink or two,

1375
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:29,290
be happy for you and go back to my world.

1376
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:36,250
Or I can be shocked and
jealous seeing all this glitter,

1377
01:17:36,870 --> 01:17:38,500
drink your booze,
enjoy your hospitality,

1378
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:40,700
and puke it out before
I go back to my world.

1379
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:42,910
But this beautiful night....

1380
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:45,250
...is expecting neither from me.

1381
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:51,040
For, the real owner of
all that you see here...

1382
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:53,200
...happens to be me!

1383
01:17:59,330 --> 01:18:01,200
In your father's betrayal,

1384
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,160
in this empire that you've built,

1385
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:09,160
in this property where
we're sitting now,

1386
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:14,620
had fallen the tears of my family, my
mother and my sisters, and you know that.

1387
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:18,790
You also know that this has been
built upon my father's blood.

1388
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:23,040
If someone is well aware
of the crime he has committed,

1389
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:26,450
and still continues to live his life,

1390
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:28,450
enjoying all the privileges
that came with it,

1391
01:18:28,450 --> 01:18:30,450
without feeling even
an iota of remorse,

1392
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:34,750
then a Judgement becomes inevitable,
because justice has to be served.

1393
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,500
A verdict!

1394
01:18:39,450 --> 01:18:41,000
That one double-edged word,

1395
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,120
which resides within
both 'justice'...

1396
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,700
...and 'revenge'.

1397
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:47,540
'Theerppu'.

1398
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:53,620
Till now, I had wished only to
give a tight slap across your face,

1399
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:55,750
if I ever ran into you.

1400
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:57,620
But... not anymore.

1401
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:03,370
Your husband's history of betrayal...

1402
01:19:03,950 --> 01:19:05,290
... has just begun unravelling.

1403
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:09,410
The three of you are the jury here.

1404
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,450
I am Abdullah Marakkar...

1405
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:17,790
The Supreme Judge, here.

1406
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
What's your name?

1407
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:24,660
Mythili.

1408
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:27,500
Wow! Everything is perfect!

1409
01:19:30,450 --> 01:19:31,540
Go ahead!

1410
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:33,790
Narrate the rest of the story yourself.

1411
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:37,000
The Advocate read the
agreement aloud for my father.

1412
01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:39,830
What was it?

1413
01:19:40,290 --> 01:19:42,660
That we'll take only the
beachfront and the adjacent 4 acres,

1414
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:43,700
and that we won't touch the rest.

1415
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:49,870
This story of this treachery by
your king and his daddy,

1416
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:52,500
can't be confined to a
single movie, my dear.

1417
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:56,330
It's as vast as, say, a "Game of Thrones".

1418
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:00,080
Tell us the next scene, Ram.

1419
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:04,750
Say it, man!

1420
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,040
Mr. Menon...

1421
01:20:08,330 --> 01:20:09,330
Mr. Nair...

1422
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:13,080
We need that ancient house along
with the beachfront property.

1423
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:16,580
Not just the beachfront property.
They're asking for the house too.

1424
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:19,080
She'll cancel the deal if she
doesn't get the entire property.

1425
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,870
Else, we just drop
this deal altogether.

1426
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:23,330
Or else, she'll drop this deal.

1427
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,410
-What?
-Just come with me.

1428
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:28,870
Just a minute.
I'll be right back.

1429
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,120
Please wait.

1430
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:32,910
Hey! Look!

1431
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,080
What is it?

1432
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:36,500
Look at her hair, dude.

1433
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:38,000
It's really nice, right?

1434
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:42,250
What?

1435
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:43,750
Is this really necessary?

1436
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:50,080
When the tile company ran into
losses and I was in debt of millions,

1437
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:52,040
I had begged your landlord
dad to help me out.

1438
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:54,080
He didn't give me
a single penny.

1439
01:20:54,410 --> 01:20:55,410
So, you better shut up!

1440
01:20:58,450 --> 01:21:00,000
Menon, please come.

1441
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:01,700
What is it, Nair?

1442
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:07,700
Now stop gawking and study!

1443
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:10,540
-What is it?
-Come with me.

1444
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:15,160
What should we tell her now?

1445
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,290
If we agree to this,

1446
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:18,830
it should profit us too, right?

1447
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:20,040
That, she will ensure.

1448
01:21:20,330 --> 01:21:21,870
-She must!
-How?

1449
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,910
A foreign company cannot come to India...

1450
01:21:25,370 --> 01:21:27,700
... and start something
on its own, as of now.

1451
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:31,040
They have to buy land in the
name of an Indian citizen first,

1452
01:21:31,410 --> 01:21:33,750
and then, he has to
lease it to the company.

1453
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:36,700
Or else, we must make these
foreigners our overseas partners,

1454
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:38,950
for the trade that we're conducting here.

1455
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,080
It will work out, right?

1456
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:41,700
There won't be any
problem, right?

1457
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:45,540
If you ask me so... what we're going
to do, is completely problematic!

1458
01:21:46,330 --> 01:21:48,250
So, first you decide...

1459
01:21:48,290 --> 01:21:49,620
whether we have to do it or not.

1460
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:50,950
Let me know after that.

1461
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:52,160
I didn't mean that.

1462
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,370
I... err...

1463
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:55,000
You go ahead.
I'm listening.

1464
01:21:57,370 --> 01:21:58,370
Are you sure?

1465
01:21:58,700 --> 01:21:59,660
I am sure.

1466
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:01,160
Then I'll tell you
one more fact.

1467
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:03,700
If people without a conscience,

1468
01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:05,700
start acting as if they
have a conscience,

1469
01:22:05,790 --> 01:22:07,540
it will not only be
difficult for them,

1470
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:09,750
but also for the others who
are trying to help them out.

1471
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:13,580
So... stop this 'acting', first.

1472
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:15,830
This is your only opportunity.

1473
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:18,000
We're giving Lakhs
to Basheerkka, right?

1474
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:19,410
And not for free, right?

1475
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:22,450
I'll make the
necessary corrections...

1476
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:24,790
...in the agreement that
we read out to him.

1477
01:22:24,830 --> 01:22:25,830
Leave that to me.

1478
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:29,160
Get the property registered
in your name first.

1479
01:22:30,290 --> 01:22:32,040
You don't have to be
so guilty about it.

1480
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,120
What about you then?

1481
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:34,450
Your share?

1482
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:36,410
After we sign the
deal with them,

1483
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:40,080
I'll draft another agreement, which
will be between the two of us.

1484
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:42,830
Since the moral risk in
this case is totally yours,

1485
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:45,700
from the profit we
make from this deal,

1486
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,580
80% will be yours.

1487
01:22:48,290 --> 01:22:49,330
20% will be mine.

1488
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:56,830
We need to ask one more thing.

1489
01:22:57,620 --> 01:23:02,910
After your death, your son needs to have
a hold over the company and the profit.

1490
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,200
Also, the profit sharing
between Ram and Kalyan,

1491
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:07,580
shall continue to be
on the same terms.

1492
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,160
Okay?

1493
01:23:13,790 --> 01:23:14,790
We are ready.

1494
01:23:14,830 --> 01:23:16,660
But there are certain conditions.

1495
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,160
Okay!

1496
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,700
Book Cricket
Ramkumar - 4, Abdullah - 2

1497
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:39,160
Sahib, the agreeement was
read out to you, right?

1498
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:41,450
-Yes.
-You want to read it once again?

1499
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:43,200
No.

1500
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:44,790
The advocate had read it out to me.

1501
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:50,910
You can sign here.

1502
01:23:51,870 --> 01:23:53,370
I don't know how to sign.

1503
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:55,830
Do you have a stamp pad?

1504
01:23:56,450 --> 01:23:57,790
Get him the stamp pad.

1505
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:03,580
-Where?
-Over here.

1506
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:07,620
Yes!

1507
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Six!

1508
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:16,160
Come on, continue.

1509
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:24,330
Your turn.

1510
01:24:31,370 --> 01:24:32,370
Hey Nair!

1511
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:38,120
Don't tell him that I'm here.

1512
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:44,620
Are you studying?

1513
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:46,700
-No. We're playing the game of dots.
-Carry on!

1514
01:24:47,450 --> 01:24:48,450
Nair!

1515
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:50,790
Hey Nair!

1516
01:24:58,750 --> 01:24:59,790
Sahib....

1517
01:25:00,450 --> 01:25:04,120
That white lady's people are
asking me to vacate my house.

1518
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:07,700
Did you add our home too
to the sale deed?

1519
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:08,950
Sahib, let us sit
inside and talk.

1520
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:10,330
Just give me a yes or no.

1521
01:25:10,410 --> 01:25:12,950
Did you add my home too,
when you wrote the sale deed?

1522
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,120
Oh no, Sahib!

1523
01:25:14,410 --> 01:25:16,330
I didn't write the agreements, right?

1524
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,250
It was the foreign
company people, right?

1525
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:21,450
Didn't I ask you to sign it only after
hearing what's written in the agreement?

1526
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:23,620
Since you can't read,

1527
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:26,410
Advocate Menon had read
it out for you, right?

1528
01:25:32,290 --> 01:25:33,290
He is inside, right?

1529
01:25:35,450 --> 01:25:36,500
Yes.

1530
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:37,830
Didn't I read out everything?

1531
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,950
It was an agreement to
sell the whole property.

1532
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:42,290
In the agreement you read
out to me, it was specifically stated

1533
01:25:42,330 --> 01:25:43,830
that they will take only
the beachfront area,

1534
01:25:43,870 --> 01:25:45,450
and won't touch my house
and surroundings. Wasn't it so?

1535
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:48,040
No. That's not what
we said or read out.

1536
01:25:48,330 --> 01:25:50,000
Even if that was the case,
you stand to lose nothing.

1537
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:53,290
You're getting eight lakhs for the
whole property including the house.

1538
01:25:53,330 --> 01:25:54,660
Isn't that a huge amount?

1539
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:57,870
You can repay all your debts,
well, to an extent, with that.

1540
01:25:58,370 --> 01:25:59,370
If not anything else,

1541
01:25:59,450 --> 01:26:02,450
you can at least meet your own
medical expenses properly, right?

1542
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,290
Longevity is more important
than anything else, right?

1543
01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:08,910
I haven't come to talk
about the money, Nair.

1544
01:26:10,450 --> 01:26:13,950
The two of you made me sell
off my house as well, huh?

1545
01:26:13,950 --> 01:26:17,580
That house has played host even to the
Prophet's disciples. Do you know that?

1546
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:19,370
Leave alone quoting a price for it,

1547
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:22,540
I can't even imagine selling it.

1548
01:26:23,330 --> 01:26:24,700
Not just me.

1549
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,330
No one can do that.

1550
01:26:26,910 --> 01:26:29,040
Even if you think about doing that,

1551
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:32,580
God will not forgive you.

1552
01:26:33,910 --> 01:26:35,250
Let go of him, Basheerkka.

1553
01:27:04,450 --> 01:27:07,200
There's no point in manhandling us
after signing the documents.

1554
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:14,120
Without spite or hatred in one's mind,

1555
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,910
if one forgives the sinners,

1556
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:20,080
it is supposed to be equal to
offering a thousand prayers.

1557
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:33,870
But... for what you
have done here now,

1558
01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:35,750
sooner or later,

1559
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:38,580
you will have to face retribution.
A 'Theerppu'!

1560
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:43,660
But it won't be from me.

1561
01:27:44,290 --> 01:27:45,290
It will be from Allah!

1562
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,040
What's your problem now?

1563
01:28:06,830 --> 01:28:08,080
Whatever I am doing is legal.

1564
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,200
Legal?

1565
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:13,250
Sooner or later, you, me and our son
Ram, will have to suffer for this.

1566
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:14,410
Wait and watch!

1567
01:28:14,450 --> 01:28:16,250
He cursed you from the
bottom of his heart.

1568
01:28:17,790 --> 01:28:20,200
At least go, fall at his feet and
seek his forgiveness!

1569
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:30,540
Children shouldn't be around
when elders are talking.

1570
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Go inside, son.

1571
01:28:39,660 --> 01:28:40,660
Priest..,

1572
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:45,950
This country existed for so long...

1573
01:28:46,450 --> 01:28:48,830
... only because of a mutual understanding.

1574
01:28:49,370 --> 01:28:50,370
Right?

1575
01:28:54,330 --> 01:28:59,160
When my Uncle from the Arabia said
that I should be sent to a school,

1576
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:01,870
my father told my uncle,
"He has this field"

1577
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:04,450
"This farm"

1578
01:29:05,410 --> 01:29:07,290
"We just have to save money"

1579
01:29:07,950 --> 01:29:09,250
"This country is a good place"

1580
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:15,000
"This country and its people...

1581
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:17,120
... will never create any trouble"

1582
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,410
"We can hire people to
read and write for us"

1583
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:25,700
"You just have to be
able to afford it"

1584
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,540
It was my father's last word.

1585
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:31,500
An old Hajiyar's verdict.

1586
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:39,410
You can call it arrogance too.

1587
01:29:41,870 --> 01:29:44,200
My father trusted
this country so much!

1588
01:29:47,620 --> 01:29:52,080
Though the tears of my entire
family has fallen on this land today,

1589
01:29:54,410 --> 01:29:55,830
I understood a fact.

1590
01:29:57,620 --> 01:29:59,290
That you people are not my friends...

1591
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:04,660
... and you can never be, either.

1592
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:08,000
Never!

1593
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:20,450
I've always considered you
like my own brother, Nair.

1594
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:22,750
And yet, you did this to us?

1595
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:25,910
Where will we go with
these three children?

1596
01:30:26,950 --> 01:30:28,620
Beewathu...

1597
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:29,700
You go inside.

1598
01:30:30,450 --> 01:30:32,450
Women don't have
to come out and assert.

1599
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:33,790
Got it?

1600
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:46,950
How many days do I
have left, to vacate?

1601
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:48,950
They have to start
work within two days.

1602
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:50,910
But you can take a week, Ikka.

1603
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:52,620
To pack all this, you'll need...

1604
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:55,410
I'll handle all that.

1605
01:30:56,330 --> 01:30:57,500
You both may leave now.

1606
01:31:00,370 --> 01:31:01,410
I will shift from here.

1607
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:03,500
I will shift within two days.

1608
01:31:05,950 --> 01:31:06,950
Well...

1609
01:31:07,410 --> 01:31:08,910
Aren't you taking your children along?

1610
01:31:09,620 --> 01:31:10,620
Forgot that too?

1611
01:31:11,830 --> 01:31:14,700
Aren't you doing all
this for their sake?

1612
01:31:16,330 --> 01:31:17,330
Abdu!

1613
01:31:17,330 --> 01:31:18,790
Send your friends out.

1614
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:20,830
Abdu, my book?

1615
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Sahib...

1616
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:29,870
One share of the profit we
make from this business,

1617
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:31,160
will be yours....

1618
01:31:33,410 --> 01:31:34,410
Allah!

1619
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:38,370
Do I have to hear that too, Nair?

1620
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:43,540
My footwear...

1621
01:31:46,950 --> 01:31:49,160
I was furious at my father, that day.

1622
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:52,250
"What you did was a grave sin, Dad"

1623
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:54,790
"It's an unforgivable sin"...
I said all that.

1624
01:31:54,830 --> 01:31:58,870
That's Malcolm Marshall bowling and the
ball hits the bat and he's gone! He's gone!

1625
01:31:58,910 --> 01:32:00,830
This will put an end
to Abdu's bragging!

1626
01:32:02,370 --> 01:32:03,700
Come here!

1627
01:32:05,410 --> 01:32:07,910
My dad slapped me on
my face that day.

1628
01:32:08,910 --> 01:32:11,120
That pain still
remains on this cheek.

1629
01:32:26,870 --> 01:32:27,870
Sorry to say this, sir.

1630
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:29,910
Sir is not at all co-operative.

1631
01:32:29,910 --> 01:32:30,950
What do you mean?

1632
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:32,040
Please, please.

1633
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,120
Now don't make this an ego
tussle between you two.

1634
01:33:09,830 --> 01:33:11,540
I do this all the time, right?

1635
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:13,540
Move away.

1636
01:33:14,290 --> 01:33:15,450
What's this new habit?

1637
01:33:19,540 --> 01:33:21,200
What's with this new habit?

1638
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:23,330
What are you doing?

1639
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:39,500
Have it, all of you.

1640
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:43,200
How's your father's Biriyani?

1641
01:33:43,830 --> 01:33:45,250
It's delicious, father!

1642
01:33:45,330 --> 01:33:47,290
Eat until your tummy is full, dear.

1643
01:33:52,790 --> 01:33:54,040
After paying off the debts,

1644
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:57,410
I have deposited the remaining
Rs. 2 Lakhs in the bank, in your name.

1645
01:33:57,750 --> 01:34:00,040
Here are the documents.

1646
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:01,040
In the bank?

1647
01:34:01,290 --> 01:34:02,290
In my name?

1648
01:34:02,370 --> 01:34:03,370
Yes!

1649
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:05,040
And...

1650
01:34:06,410 --> 01:34:08,000
I sold our car.

1651
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:09,580
For scrap price.

1652
01:34:09,870 --> 01:34:11,660
What's the point
in keeping it now?

1653
01:34:12,910 --> 01:34:14,290
Why are you saying all this now?

1654
01:34:14,790 --> 01:34:15,870
You will be with us, no?

1655
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:18,540
All of us...

1656
01:34:19,910 --> 01:34:22,080
... can shift to my
sister's house in Manjeri.

1657
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:25,830
Though it's not as spacious,

1658
01:34:25,950 --> 01:34:27,000
it's a good house.

1659
01:34:27,330 --> 01:34:28,620
She will have some company too.

1660
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:31,200
Eat, dear.

1661
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:32,700
Have your food, Abdu.

1662
01:34:44,370 --> 01:34:47,200
They know what
happened to my father.

1663
01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:13,410
Father!

1664
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,160
You left us, huh?

1665
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:19,080
You left us?

1666
01:35:19,330 --> 01:35:20,410
Father!

1667
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:21,450
Coward!

1668
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,160
Coward!

1669
01:35:23,790 --> 01:35:25,080
You left us?

1670
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:28,200
You left us behind?

1671
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:34,620
Father!

1672
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:38,160
Father!

1673
01:35:44,830 --> 01:35:46,580
Father!

1674
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:53,120
It's okay even if we
lose the land, Musaliyar.

1675
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:56,450
We should at least stop them
from demolishing the house.

1676
01:35:56,870 --> 01:35:58,040
For my husband!

1677
01:35:59,540 --> 01:36:01,080
He loved it more
than anything.

1678
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:03,450
Nothing is possible now, Beewathu.

1679
01:36:03,790 --> 01:36:04,910
There will be a huge ruckus.

1680
01:36:05,330 --> 01:36:07,660
They will riot all over town.

1681
01:36:07,950 --> 01:36:09,830
Nothing is possible now.
You may go.

1682
01:36:14,620 --> 01:36:15,660
Wait.

1683
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:18,120
There is one way.

1684
01:36:18,750 --> 01:36:20,250
When are they going to demolish it?

1685
01:36:20,330 --> 01:36:21,330
Immediately.

1686
01:36:22,330 --> 01:36:26,250
Achu's son Chandrabhanu is working at the
archaeological department in the town.

1687
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:28,160
Let's go and meet him.

1688
01:36:28,290 --> 01:36:31,200
We can find out if there are some
Government rules that may help us.

1689
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:33,290
Why do you have to take
so much effort, Musaliyar?

1690
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:34,830
We too have boys with us!

1691
01:36:34,910 --> 01:36:36,580
Let them start a riot.

1692
01:36:36,910 --> 01:36:38,160
We'll reply in the same coin.

1693
01:36:38,370 --> 01:36:39,370
Shut up, boy!

1694
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,200
Riots and fights may not always be
won by the side of truth.

1695
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:47,700
Even if a truthful minority
fights with the majority,

1696
01:36:47,790 --> 01:36:50,580
it's the majority that ends up
winning, most of the time.

1697
01:36:50,790 --> 01:36:51,790
You know that?

1698
01:36:51,790 --> 01:36:53,370
So shut up and go home!

1699
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:54,500
Get lost!

1700
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:11,160
Oh my God!

1701
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:13,950
This is 400 years old.

1702
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:19,200
If only a quarter of it
has been demolished so far,

1703
01:37:19,290 --> 01:37:20,870
we can stop the demolition,

1704
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:25,160
and find ways to make the Government
preserve the house, at least.

1705
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:28,660
You delayed it so far,
despite having this with you?

1706
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:32,750
You keep preventing your children from
going to schools and studying English,

1707
01:37:32,790 --> 01:37:35,700
and keep sending them
to your Madrasas.

1708
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:38,410
And finally your
documents and properties

1709
01:37:38,410 --> 01:37:40,620
will be usurped by people
who can read and write.

1710
01:37:41,410 --> 01:37:42,410
Someone come with me.

1711
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:43,660
No. Just one of you.

1712
01:37:43,950 --> 01:37:44,950
Abdu...

1713
01:37:45,450 --> 01:37:46,450
Go with him, son.

1714
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:47,750
Come, come!

1715
01:37:48,870 --> 01:37:50,200
-Son..
-Yes, mother.

1716
01:37:51,450 --> 01:37:52,910
You shouldn't get anxious.

1717
01:37:53,290 --> 01:37:54,580
Your mother has no one else.

1718
01:38:09,660 --> 01:38:10,660
Hey!

1719
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:13,330
That Archaeology officer is coming.

1720
01:38:13,370 --> 01:38:14,660
Detonate it. Quickly!

1721
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:15,750
Make it fast!

1722
01:38:15,870 --> 01:38:16,910
Hey! Stop it!

1723
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:18,080
Don't demolish it.

1724
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:19,790
This is illegal.

1725
01:38:19,790 --> 01:38:21,500
-Demolish it!
-Quick!

1726
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:22,950
Do it quickly!

1727
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:24,410
No!
Stop it.

1728
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:26,750
-Don't demolish it.
-What are you doing, Abdu?

1729
01:38:26,790 --> 01:38:28,870
Someone stop him.

1730
01:38:28,910 --> 01:38:30,750
Don't go there.

1731
01:38:30,750 --> 01:38:32,540
-Stop it.
-Abdu!

1732
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:34,250
Stop him!

1733
01:38:34,290 --> 01:38:35,450
Abdu, stop.

1734
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:38,500
Abdu!

1735
01:38:40,410 --> 01:38:41,410
Abdu!

1736
01:38:41,830 --> 01:38:43,250
Son...

1737
01:38:45,580 --> 01:38:46,580
Abdu!

1738
01:38:46,910 --> 01:38:48,290
Hey Abdu!

1739
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,040
What does...

1740
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:00,500
... the Jury say?

1741
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:05,160
What punishment
will bring justice?

1742
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:13,790
From this silence,
I should understand that...

1743
01:39:14,450 --> 01:39:19,250
the majority does not approve
of any kind of punishment.

1744
01:39:21,330 --> 01:39:22,330
Forget it.

1745
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:28,620
Does the Jury at least acknowledge the
fact that a crime was committed here?

1746
01:39:32,370 --> 01:39:33,370
Then...

1747
01:39:33,950 --> 01:39:35,870
against the majority,

1748
01:39:36,790 --> 01:39:39,080
and with conscience
as the only witness,

1749
01:39:39,410 --> 01:39:43,950
Abdullah Marakkar, the Supreme
Judge must proclaim the judgement.

1750
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:46,200
The final judgement.

1751
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:55,540
An ancient house which had
a history of centuries.

1752
01:39:56,540 --> 01:39:59,080
A house which was
demolished through treachery.

1753
01:40:00,250 --> 01:40:02,870
For orchestrating that demolition,

1754
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,910
and for conspiring towards it,

1755
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:07,540
for being the beneficiary
of that betrayal,

1756
01:40:07,580 --> 01:40:11,660
for gaining social and
financial stature through it,

1757
01:40:12,410 --> 01:40:14,540
for causing a death
due to that betrayal,

1758
01:40:14,620 --> 01:40:18,790
and for being responsible for a
family that was lost in the streets,

1759
01:40:19,370 --> 01:40:23,160
V. Ramkumar Nair, son of Vikraman Nair
has been sentenced by this Court,

1760
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:25,450
this Court of God,

1761
01:40:27,450 --> 01:40:29,250
...to death!

1762
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:31,000
Hey Abdu!
What is this?

1763
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:32,500
Sit down!

1764
01:40:33,870 --> 01:40:36,660
You should see certain
things before you are killed.

1765
01:40:39,330 --> 01:40:40,830
You should also experience...

1766
01:40:40,870 --> 01:40:43,500
...the trauma of losing everything
that you hold dear in life.

1767
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:46,000
The shock of seeing things getting
destroyed right in front of your eyes.

1768
01:40:47,450 --> 01:40:48,660
But...

1769
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:51,750
... your mother?

1770
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:53,450
She died ten years back.

1771
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:55,330
She suffered a lot.

1772
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:57,120
She had tuberculosis.

1773
01:40:59,870 --> 01:41:00,870
Ah!

1774
01:41:01,580 --> 01:41:03,000
Good people are
always like that.

1775
01:41:03,660 --> 01:41:05,330
They die only after
suffering a lot.

1776
01:41:05,660 --> 01:41:06,950
She liked you a lot.

1777
01:41:07,790 --> 01:41:09,250
She always used
to talk about you.

1778
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:15,910
But my dear Ram, dead people
are not going to know...

1779
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:18,370
... who died and who killed whom.

1780
01:41:19,410 --> 01:41:20,790
But you don't have to be scared.

1781
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:22,750
Since you're not a good man,

1782
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:25,080
you will never suffer
before you die.

1783
01:41:27,450 --> 01:41:29,040
Everything will be quick.

1784
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Well...

1785
01:41:32,410 --> 01:41:35,620
Should we not toss a coin
before the match begins, Potty?

1786
01:41:36,950 --> 01:41:39,700
How can we forget old
habits so easily?

1787
01:41:46,290 --> 01:41:47,290
Yes!

1788
01:41:51,830 --> 01:41:52,830
Hey!

1789
01:41:53,370 --> 01:41:54,870
Don't move!

1790
01:41:57,410 --> 01:41:59,120
-Call the police!
-They will come now.

1791
01:42:03,660 --> 01:42:04,660
Where is Kalyan?

1792
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:06,040
He's not answering.

1793
01:42:06,450 --> 01:42:11,330
Amitabh Bachchan's dialogue
from "Sholay"

1794
01:42:14,950 --> 01:42:16,660
Wow! I've found the perfect item!

1795
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:25,200
âª We shall never break this friendship of ours âª
Song from 'Sholay'

1796
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:27,950
I'll give you one chance.

1797
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:29,870
Heads or tails?

1798
01:42:31,450 --> 01:42:32,750
-Heads!
-Wait!

1799
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:35,330
If it's heads,
I will kill you.

1800
01:42:36,410 --> 01:42:37,410
If it's tails, I won't.

1801
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:50,040
Hey Ram!

1802
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:54,620
Even your relics are saying
that I should kill you.

1803
01:42:55,950 --> 01:42:56,950
Heads!

1804
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:03,040
Death by relics.

1805
01:43:07,790 --> 01:43:12,870
The cricket bat used by Kapil
Dev when he scored 175...

1806
01:43:15,290 --> 01:43:16,330
Wow!

1807
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,790
Is this for real?

1808
01:43:20,660 --> 01:43:22,790
No one could watch
that innings back then.

1809
01:43:22,950 --> 01:43:24,330
BBC was on strike.

1810
01:43:24,790 --> 01:43:25,790
But today,

1811
01:43:26,290 --> 01:43:28,790
the highlights of that
thunderous innings,

1812
01:43:29,250 --> 01:43:30,870
you can watch it live.

1813
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:46,330
Wow!

1814
01:43:46,910 --> 01:43:47,950
Abdu...

1815
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:49,950
-Potty, stop him.
-Stop it!

1816
01:43:54,660 --> 01:43:55,870
Well...

1817
01:43:56,290 --> 01:43:58,750
I need a ball to play cricket.

1818
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:00,200
Ball?

1819
01:44:00,620 --> 01:44:01,620
Yes!

1820
01:44:01,750 --> 01:44:05,080
The foundation stone of my
palace which was demolished.

1821
01:44:05,950 --> 01:44:08,790
Let it be our cricket
ball for tonight.

1822
01:44:08,910 --> 01:44:09,910
Hey Potty!

1823
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:10,950
You do the bowling.

1824
01:44:12,950 --> 01:44:14,200
Do you remember?

1825
01:44:14,830 --> 01:44:18,330
These guys never gave you
bowling or batting back then.

1826
01:44:19,290 --> 01:44:20,540
You were always the umpire.

1827
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:22,330
Potty Bird!

1828
01:44:24,370 --> 01:44:25,830
Today you will bowl...

1829
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,410
I will bat,

1830
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,290
and he will be the umpire.

1831
01:44:34,120 --> 01:44:35,120
This...

1832
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:36,870
... will be our stumps.

1833
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:41,080
Throw it.

1834
01:44:43,620 --> 01:44:44,700
Throw it!

1835
01:44:48,540 --> 01:44:49,580
We'll know now,

1836
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:53,330
if this is Kapil Dev's original bat,

1837
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:57,370
or fake like Saddam Hussein's wine.

1838
01:45:00,290 --> 01:45:02,120
Okay.
First ball.

1839
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,370
Shot!

1840
01:45:40,950 --> 01:45:42,370
This is original, indeed!

1841
01:45:43,450 --> 01:45:45,120
He should have been here too.

1842
01:45:45,290 --> 01:45:46,290
Kalyan Menon!

1843
01:45:46,950 --> 01:45:48,910
-Where is he?
-He is in the Police.

1844
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:50,330
He's a DIG.

1845
01:45:50,330 --> 01:45:51,750
-He will come now.
-It's alright.

1846
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:53,200
He's a cop, right?

1847
01:45:53,790 --> 01:45:55,410
He'll come only after
the villain dies.

1848
01:45:55,450 --> 01:45:56,750
He's also a partner
in this company.

1849
01:45:56,790 --> 01:45:58,080
It's not like messing with me.

1850
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:00,580
Hey Ram!

1851
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:03,950
If your father was the
Dhritharashtra in this story,

1852
01:46:03,950 --> 01:46:05,410
Advocate Menon was the Shakuni.

1853
01:46:05,450 --> 01:46:07,120
If you are Duryodhan,

1854
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:08,660
he is Dusshasan.

1855
01:46:09,830 --> 01:46:13,160
So first, I'll break your thigh!

1856
01:46:13,870 --> 01:46:16,080
After that, I will
tear open his chest!

1857
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:18,580
Hey Potty!

1858
01:46:18,790 --> 01:46:19,790
Announce the score.

1859
01:46:19,910 --> 01:46:20,910
Six!

1860
01:46:20,910 --> 01:46:23,160
Hail Lakshman Sena!

1861
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:25,450
Hail Kothadiyaji!

1862
01:46:25,450 --> 01:46:28,950
Hail Chandran Pillaji!

1863
01:46:28,950 --> 01:46:32,620
Hail Lakshman Sena!

1864
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:35,950
Hail Kothadiyaji!

1865
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,750
Hail Chandran Pillaji!

1866
01:46:39,790 --> 01:46:44,330
Hail Lakshman Sena!

1867
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,330
My dear people,

1868
01:46:47,870 --> 01:46:50,120
The fireworks are about to begin.

1869
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:52,910
For your kind attention,

1870
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:55,790
no one should go
towards that area.

1871
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:58,250
Before the fireworks begin,

1872
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:03,540
All India Lakshman Sena's
constant companion,

1873
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:10,870
and the famous DJ Arun Singh Keshav
will be presenting a brand new song.

1874
01:47:10,910 --> 01:47:14,540
A brand new song in
praise of Lakshman Sena...

1875
01:47:14,540 --> 01:47:16,540
...will be performed on this stage.

1876
01:47:47,410 --> 01:47:52,330
Hail Lakshman Kothadiyaji..!!

1877
01:47:52,370 --> 01:47:56,370
Hail Chandran Pillaji..!!

1878
01:47:56,370 --> 01:48:00,870
Hail Lakshman Kothadiyaji..!!

1879
01:48:00,910 --> 01:48:05,790
Hail, the Lion of the South,
Chandran Pillaji..!!

1880
01:48:05,870 --> 01:48:11,330
Hail Lakshman Sena!

1881
01:48:11,370 --> 01:48:14,540
Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail!

1882
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:43,370
âª On his horse,
has come our beloved leader! âª

01:49:05,790 --> 01:49:07,370

01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:05,660
âª Let victory prevail âª

1899
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:11,370
âª Let victory prevail âª

1900
01:50:11,370 --> 01:50:14,500
âª After wreaking havoc
in Raavanâs Lanka, âª

1901
01:50:14,540 --> 01:50:17,750
âª With his master resting
right in his heart, âª

1902
01:50:17,790 --> 01:50:22,540
âª Riding beside
our great leader, âª

1903

âª Our âLion of the Southâ âª

1904
01:50:30,540 --> 01:50:33,660
âª After wreaking havoc

1905
01:50:33,750 --> 01:50:36,910
âª With his master resting
right in his heart, âª

1906

âª Riding beside
our great leader, âª

1907

âª Our âLion of the
Southâ, Mr. Pillai! âª

1908
01:50:43,330 --> 01:50:49,620
âª PILLA PILLA PILLA PILLA...
PILLA PILLA PILLAJIâ¦ âª

1909
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:50,910

âª Live Long, Live Long, âª

1912

âª Dear, Dear, Dear Chief.., âª

1913
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:59,200
âª The only protector of
our faith.. is YOU! âª

1914
01:51:04,910 --> 01:51:06,040
âª Forward! âª

1915
01:51:11,250 --> 01:51:12,250
âª Forward! âª

1916
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:15,330
âª Tonightâ¦ for usâ¦
is both Holi and Diwali..! âª

1917
01:51:15,410 --> 01:51:18,580
âª Our eyes shall project
the flames of bravery..! âª

1918
01:51:18,580 --> 01:51:21,790
âª If you dare us,
if you flash a knife at us âª

1919
01:51:21,790 --> 01:51:24,120
âª YOU ARE DEAD,
BURIED AND GONE!! âª

1920
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:24,950
âª Finished! âª

1921
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:28,080
âª Tonightâ¦ for usâ¦
is both Holi and Diwali..! âª

1922
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:31,370
âª Our eyes shall project
the flames of bravery..! âª

1923
01:51:31,370 --> 01:51:34,580
âª If you dare us,
if you flash a knife at us âª

1924
01:51:34,580 --> 01:51:37,040
âª YOU ARE DEAD,
BURIED AND GONE!! âª

1925
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:37,750
âª Finished! âª

1926
01:51:37,790 --> 01:51:38,950
âª If you sing this! âª

1927
01:51:39,370 --> 01:51:40,580
âª If you get this! âª

1928
01:51:40,950 --> 01:51:44,160
âª If you sing our song,
If you get our song, âª

1929
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:46,540
âª Youâ¦ will transform
into a great patriot..! âª

1930
01:51:46,580 --> 01:51:49,250
âª YES! YES! YES! YES!
YES! YES! YES! YES! âª

1931
01:52:33,830 --> 01:52:35,410
Ram, do something!

1932
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:39,040
Get me the iPad.

1933
01:52:39,410 --> 01:52:40,410
Get me that tablet!

1934
01:52:47,830 --> 01:52:49,450
Switch off the lights
when I tell you.

1935
01:52:49,830 --> 01:52:50,830
Give me your phone.

1936
01:52:51,790 --> 01:52:52,790
Fast!

1937
01:52:59,790 --> 01:53:00,830
Tab.

1938
01:53:05,410 --> 01:53:06,410
Turn it off.

1939
01:53:36,750 --> 01:53:37,950
Hello guests.

1940
01:53:38,700 --> 01:53:40,910
My name is Anastasia Ober.

1941
01:53:41,200 --> 01:53:43,450
-And I am the founder, initiator..
-Go and check on him.

1942
01:53:44,790 --> 01:53:46,120
No. Ram will handle it.

1943
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:47,580
May you revel amongst relics.

1944
01:53:47,620 --> 01:53:49,200
Isn't this our old white lady?

1945
01:53:49,250 --> 01:53:50,790
So enjoy your stay...

1946
01:53:51,410 --> 01:53:53,000
... in the Accadio fun room.

1947
01:53:58,450 --> 01:53:59,950
You caught hold of her too?

1948
01:53:59,950 --> 01:54:01,450
Mythili!
Mythili!

1949
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:02,790
-Switch on the lights, Mythili!
-You schmuck!

1950
01:54:02,830 --> 01:54:03,700
Mythili!

1951
01:54:03,750 --> 01:54:04,830
Yes, it's back!

1952
01:54:17,790 --> 01:54:18,910
Come on!

1953
01:54:22,250 --> 01:54:23,290
Come!

1954
01:54:45,160 --> 01:54:46,830
That's a great shot, Marakkar!

1955
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:48,450
Marakkar, damn it!

1956
01:55:04,950 --> 01:55:06,580
Hey Ram!

1957
01:55:06,790 --> 01:55:09,410
Nunchaku and Karate
are not meant for you!

1958
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:14,580
The 'Mohiniyattam'
dance suits you best!

1959
01:55:17,410 --> 01:55:20,540
You idiot! Be careful.
You will hurt yourself with it.

1960
01:55:25,330 --> 01:55:26,910
I just told you, right?

1961
01:55:51,660 --> 01:55:53,080
Abdu, let him go!

1962
01:55:53,250 --> 01:55:54,250
Enough!

1963
01:55:57,700 --> 01:55:58,750
Ram, no!

1964
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:00,330
Let go of me!

1965
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:11,120
Ram, that's enough.

1966
01:56:11,580 --> 01:56:12,620
Abdu!

1967
01:56:12,700 --> 01:56:13,870
Ram, stop it!

1968
01:56:15,330 --> 01:56:16,500
Abdu, let him go!

1969
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:22,160
You....

1970
01:56:22,910 --> 01:56:24,450
You will shoot Gandhiji?

1971
01:56:25,290 --> 01:56:26,330
Will you?

1972
01:56:32,370 --> 01:56:33,910
Potty, stop them!

1973
01:56:33,950 --> 01:56:35,910
Hey Potty! Come
and hold the gun!

1974
01:56:36,910 --> 01:56:38,290
Abdu, let him go!

1975
01:56:38,620 --> 01:56:39,870
Abdu!

1976
01:56:41,370 --> 01:56:42,450
Abdu!

1977
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:44,410
Abdullah, let go of him!

1978
01:56:44,540 --> 01:56:45,660
Please stop!

1979
01:56:46,620 --> 01:56:48,000
Ram!
Ram!

1980
01:56:48,290 --> 01:56:50,870
-Move away, Mythili Devi.
-Ram, no!

1981
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:57,080
Ram!

1982
01:56:57,830 --> 01:56:58,950
Don't hit him, Ram!

1983
01:57:11,870 --> 01:57:13,120
Ram, stop!

1984
01:57:13,160 --> 01:57:14,250
You bloody dog!

1985
01:57:14,290 --> 01:57:16,370
If we snatched away
your father's property,

1986
01:57:16,370 --> 01:57:17,910
that's because of his incapability.

1987
01:57:17,950 --> 01:57:19,450
If he shot himself dead,

1988
01:57:19,450 --> 01:57:20,790
that's his foolishness!

1989
01:57:20,830 --> 01:57:22,620
I am both the Judge and the Jury here!

1990
01:57:23,160 --> 01:57:24,200
Enough, Ram!

1991
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:30,200
Ram!

1992
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:33,870
This is the verdict.
The finale!

1993
01:57:36,330 --> 01:57:37,950
The real Death Penalty.

1994
01:57:41,790 --> 01:57:42,870
Death... for me.

1995
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,750
Penalty... for you.

1996
01:58:13,700 --> 01:58:14,700
Ram!

1997
01:58:15,080 --> 01:58:17,080
Ram, check if he's still alive.

1998
01:58:33,330 --> 01:58:34,330
He's dead.

1999
01:58:35,250 --> 01:58:36,250
Abdu!

2000
01:58:38,450 --> 01:58:39,910
Abdu!

2001
01:58:40,290 --> 01:58:41,950
Abdu! Abdu!

2002
01:58:49,790 --> 01:58:51,000
You killed him?

2003
01:58:52,290 --> 01:58:53,330
He...

2004
01:58:54,580 --> 01:58:55,750
He was going to...

2005
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:27,950
Ram...

2006
01:59:27,950 --> 01:59:29,120
It's Kalyan.

2007
01:59:29,540 --> 01:59:30,580
Talk to him.

2008
01:59:33,290 --> 01:59:35,450
-Kalyan...
-Bro, what do I say!

2009
01:59:35,790 --> 01:59:38,540
That braggart DGP made a lightning
visit to the Commissioner's office.

2010
01:59:38,540 --> 01:59:40,870
A new Commissioner has taken charge.
A new posting.

2011
01:59:41,330 --> 01:59:42,950
A hot-headed a*****e.

2012
01:59:43,620 --> 01:59:44,620
And on top of all this,

2013
01:59:44,620 --> 01:59:46,250
there's a mess of a meeting as well.

2014
01:59:46,450 --> 01:59:47,540
I got free only now.

2015
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,450
I'll go home, change my clothes
and come there quickly.

2016
01:59:50,750 --> 01:59:51,750
Okay?

2017
01:59:52,830 --> 01:59:53,830
Hey!

2018
01:59:53,950 --> 01:59:56,200
The resort must be stunning
after your renovation, right?

2019
01:59:56,410 --> 01:59:58,000
I need to see it fully
once I get there.

2020
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59,040
I'll be there soon.

2021
01:59:59,580 --> 02:00:00,830
And one more thing.

2022
02:00:01,250 --> 02:00:02,870
Though you offered
us 20% of the profit,

2023
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:06,160
my father and myself have only received
Rs. 1.5 Million from you till date,

2024
02:00:06,160 --> 02:00:07,620
ever since the deal was closed.

2025
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:08,870
So when I come there tonight,

2026
02:00:08,870 --> 02:00:11,830
give me Rs. 20 Million in cash first,
and settle all the old accounts.

2027
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:13,580
You can show your
hospitality after that.

2028
02:00:13,580 --> 02:00:14,580
Got it?

2029
02:00:24,410 --> 02:00:25,410
Kalyan sir.

2030
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,160
He is their stooge here.

2031
02:00:27,700 --> 02:00:30,660
He's putting on this dumb act,
though he's aware of everything.

2032
02:00:31,660 --> 02:00:32,660
I know, I know.

2033
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,700
Sir, when this Covid
situation is prevailing,

2034
02:00:34,750 --> 02:00:35,830
we should not be allowing...

2035
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:39,120
...a meeting of this scale,
under any circumstance.

2036
02:00:39,160 --> 02:00:41,870
-We can't even insist them to wear masks.
-You tell me then.

2037
02:00:42,250 --> 02:00:44,080
What should I do?
Should I do a Lathi charge?

2038
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:45,870
If I upset them,
they will brand me an anti-National.

2039
02:00:45,910 --> 02:00:48,000
If I upset them, they will brand
me a Sanghi or a Muslim extremist.

2040
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:50,500
The police department lost
its honour and power long back!

2041
02:00:50,620 --> 02:00:52,250
Even if we want to take action,

2042
02:00:52,250 --> 02:00:55,330
there will be a Lathi charge
against us on social media tomorrow.

2043
02:01:15,580 --> 02:01:17,370
After a glaring gap of five years,

2044
02:01:17,410 --> 02:01:20,040
have they both come to reinstate
their Kerala business empire!

2045
02:01:20,160 --> 02:01:24,500
The Accadio South East Asia power
couple, Ramkumar and Mythili.

2046
02:01:24,830 --> 02:01:28,080
Please accept this hearty welcome from
your humble partner and Kerala Police.

2047
02:01:29,370 --> 02:01:30,910
Please accept this bouquet.

2048
02:01:31,910 --> 02:01:33,660
That crappy car lying outside?
Whose is it?

2049
02:01:33,660 --> 02:01:34,910
Brahmand Solutions?

2050
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,120
What happened?

2051
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:38,660
Any sentimental attachment?

2052
02:01:39,870 --> 02:01:40,870
Something has happened.

2053
02:01:42,290 --> 02:01:43,870
Something terrible has happened.

2054
02:01:55,660 --> 02:01:56,950
Do you know how he got here?

2055
02:01:57,500 --> 02:01:58,500
Did he have a vehicle?

2056
02:01:59,950 --> 02:02:01,000
I'm asking you.

2057
02:02:02,450 --> 02:02:05,250
No... but we had
met him in the city.

2058
02:02:06,370 --> 02:02:07,450
And?

2059
02:02:07,910 --> 02:02:10,620
And he enquired about Ram to us.

2060
02:02:10,660 --> 02:02:13,160
But we avoided him
without giving him an answer.

2061
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Where all are the CCTV
cameras installed here?

2062
02:02:21,290 --> 02:02:22,330
I need its footage.

2063
02:02:22,450 --> 02:02:23,450
If you have that,

2064
02:02:23,500 --> 02:02:26,160
we can call this an intrusion and claim
that the murder was in self-defense.

2065
02:02:26,250 --> 02:02:27,250
Where is the server?

2066
02:02:31,250 --> 02:02:32,500
It hasn't been installed.

2067
02:02:35,410 --> 02:02:36,410
Great!

2068
02:02:36,870 --> 02:02:38,620
World's greatest luxury chain!

2069
02:02:39,660 --> 02:02:40,660
Great!

2070
02:02:40,790 --> 02:02:42,160
Did he have a phone?

2071
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:47,660
Ram, it might be
in the fun room.

2072
02:02:48,540 --> 02:02:50,200
Mythili, go and check there.

2073
02:02:50,450 --> 02:02:51,790
Prabha, you go there.

2074
02:02:52,120 --> 02:02:53,120
Go!

2075
02:02:54,330 --> 02:02:55,330
Mythili, over there.

2076
02:03:53,370 --> 02:03:54,700
Found it!
Found his phone!

2077
02:03:55,160 --> 02:03:56,160
Here!

2078
02:03:57,660 --> 02:03:59,660
Mythili, he found the phone.
Come.

2079
02:04:00,290 --> 02:04:01,290
-Here you go.
-Hey Potty!

2080
02:04:01,700 --> 02:04:02,750
You're quite impressive.

2081
02:04:02,790 --> 02:04:04,080
Covering it in a handkerchief?

2082
02:04:04,120 --> 02:04:05,620
Well, I have seen it in movies.

2083
02:04:06,700 --> 02:04:07,700
Nice!

2084
02:04:09,660 --> 02:04:11,450
Hey Ram! I found
this under the sofa.

2085
02:04:18,870 --> 02:04:19,870
Keep this safe.

2086
02:04:19,950 --> 02:04:20,950
Okay.

2087
02:04:30,750 --> 02:04:31,750
Ram!

2088
02:04:31,950 --> 02:04:32,950
Search his pockets.

2089
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,410
What's that paper?

2090
02:04:43,580 --> 02:04:44,580
It's the bill from a bar.

2091
02:04:45,200 --> 02:04:46,250
Potty....

2092
02:04:48,750 --> 02:04:49,750
What's that?

2093
02:04:51,080 --> 02:04:52,540
Nexito.

2094
02:04:56,450 --> 02:04:57,910
Anti-depressant.

2095
02:05:01,580 --> 02:05:02,580
Give it to Potty.

2096
02:05:04,830 --> 02:05:06,040
Check his back-pockets.

2097
02:05:12,540 --> 02:05:13,580
Give it to Potty.

2098
02:05:15,500 --> 02:05:17,370
Pack all of it together,
and keep it there.

2099
02:05:18,580 --> 02:05:19,580
Mythili!

2100
02:05:19,620 --> 02:05:20,910
Get me the bouquet I brought.

2101
02:05:29,830 --> 02:05:30,830
Ram!

2102
02:05:31,330 --> 02:05:32,830
Take out a flower
from the bouquet.

2103
02:05:34,870 --> 02:05:35,870
Come on, do it.

2104
02:05:39,660 --> 02:05:40,950
You have killed him anyway.

2105
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:42,410
Before taking the next step,

2106
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:43,620
confess all the sins...

2107
02:05:43,660 --> 02:05:46,620
...that you and your father committed
towards Abdu and his family,

2108
02:05:46,910 --> 02:05:49,330
and place that rose
flower on his chest.

2109
02:05:50,250 --> 02:05:51,250
What about your father?

2110
02:05:51,790 --> 02:05:52,790
That's not relevant now.

2111
02:05:53,620 --> 02:05:54,910
This was really too much!

2112
02:05:56,660 --> 02:05:57,910
Though it's you who killed him,

2113
02:05:58,200 --> 02:05:59,410
it is he who has really won.

2114
02:05:59,500 --> 02:06:00,580
How?
I'll tell you later.

2115
02:06:01,370 --> 02:06:02,660
Place that flower there, first.

2116
02:06:04,660 --> 02:06:05,660
Keep it.

2117
02:06:21,080 --> 02:06:22,830
The Abdullah Marakkar that I know...

2118
02:06:23,080 --> 02:06:24,660
... might be capable
of all this rampage.

2119
02:06:25,830 --> 02:06:27,200
But what you did to him now...

2120
02:06:27,290 --> 02:06:28,540
he wouldn't have ever
done the same to you.

2121
02:06:29,500 --> 02:06:30,500
I'm sure about that.

2122
02:06:30,540 --> 02:06:31,540
Hey Kalyan!

2123
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Save me!

2124
02:06:33,660 --> 02:06:34,660
Help me!

2125
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:38,080
Help us!

2126
02:06:39,790 --> 02:06:40,910
I will.

2127
02:06:40,950 --> 02:06:41,950
I'll manage this.

2128
02:06:42,910 --> 02:06:46,500
But I will have to engage the entire
state machinery under me, for this.

2129
02:06:47,120 --> 02:06:48,250
And it will be really...

2130
02:06:48,700 --> 02:06:50,410
really, really expensive.

2131
02:06:51,410 --> 02:06:52,660
First, some hard cash.

2132
02:06:52,910 --> 02:06:53,950
And later on,

2133
02:06:53,950 --> 02:06:57,290
the expenditure to maintain the status
quo of this crime in the future.

2134
02:06:57,540 --> 02:06:58,700
I'll tell you very frankly.

2135
02:07:00,370 --> 02:07:01,370
This...

2136
02:07:02,500 --> 02:07:05,540
... is going to be a lifelong
regular entry in your balance-sheet.

2137
02:07:13,410 --> 02:07:15,450
Now, did you
understand how he won?

2138
02:07:16,540 --> 02:07:17,830
When you kill the powerless,

2139
02:07:18,250 --> 02:07:19,950
they win the war with
their very own death.

2140
02:07:24,910 --> 02:07:26,370
Can you please spare the rhetoric?

2141
02:07:26,910 --> 02:07:28,450
How much will it cost?
Tell me that.

2142
02:07:30,040 --> 02:07:31,080
8 Crores.

2143
02:07:31,870 --> 02:07:33,200
8 Crores?

2144
02:07:33,950 --> 02:07:34,950
What the...!!

2145
02:07:35,950 --> 02:07:37,290
Are you blackmailing me?

2146
02:07:37,580 --> 02:07:39,290
How dare you, you snake?

2147
02:07:39,370 --> 02:07:40,370
You forgot one thing.

2148
02:07:40,620 --> 02:07:42,040
You're also a partner in this.

2149
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:44,120
For everything that
happened in this property,

2150
02:07:44,200 --> 02:07:45,500
you are also responsible.

2151
02:07:49,790 --> 02:07:52,200
This is a property registered
in the name of Vikraman Nair,

2152
02:07:52,250 --> 02:07:53,910
and his heir Ramkumar Nair.

2153
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:56,120
As per the deal with Accadio Saket,

2154
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:58,500
Advocate Krishna Menon
and his son Kalyan Menon,

2155
02:07:58,830 --> 02:08:00,910
will have a share in the
profits from this business.

2156
02:08:02,370 --> 02:08:04,700
Anything that happens within the
privacy of this property,

2157
02:08:04,750 --> 02:08:06,870
be it debauchery or murder,

2158
02:08:07,410 --> 02:08:09,040
its complete responsibility...

2159
02:08:09,200 --> 02:08:12,000
will solely be upon Accadio's
South-East Asia head Ramkumar,

2160
02:08:12,660 --> 02:08:15,120
and quality control
head Mythili Ramkumar.

2161
02:08:15,700 --> 02:08:16,700
Moreover,

2162
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:18,660
you just grabbed
the collar of...

2163
02:08:19,080 --> 02:08:21,200
.. a Police DIG with
high political affluence.

2164
02:08:22,200 --> 02:08:24,250
So if you want to see
yourself out of this...

2165
02:08:24,660 --> 02:08:26,080
the initial sum will be,

2166
02:08:26,250 --> 02:08:27,250
8 Crores!

2167
02:08:31,200 --> 02:08:32,200
Ram!

2168
02:08:32,790 --> 02:08:35,160
You have half an hour
to take a decision.

2169
02:08:35,950 --> 02:08:37,120
Do you want to go to jail...

2170
02:08:37,580 --> 02:08:38,870
.. or do you want all this back?

2171
02:08:40,290 --> 02:08:41,830
Come with me.
Just a second.

2172
02:08:47,160 --> 02:08:48,160
Bro...

2173
02:08:48,580 --> 02:08:50,370
Though I keep bluffing unnecessarily...

2174
02:08:50,750 --> 02:08:52,660
to make my business flourish,

2175
02:08:53,160 --> 02:08:54,200
the truth is that...

2176
02:08:55,250 --> 02:08:58,000
... my financial situation is not so great,
unlike what you think.

2177
02:08:58,870 --> 02:09:00,750
Did you see all
these broken relics?

2178
02:09:02,830 --> 02:09:04,160
All are duplicate items.

2179
02:09:05,370 --> 02:09:06,370
It's just for show-off.

2180
02:09:06,370 --> 02:09:07,410
Oh!

2181
02:09:07,830 --> 02:09:09,830
Why didn't you tell this
to me all this while?

2182
02:09:11,200 --> 02:09:14,250
Well, I'm also supposed to be a
silent partner in all this, right?

2183
02:09:15,450 --> 02:09:16,790
Kalyan! Only this 8 acres,

2184
02:09:17,450 --> 02:09:18,870
and this building which is mine,

2185
02:09:19,120 --> 02:09:20,120
as well as yours.

2186
02:09:20,700 --> 02:09:22,450
I only have this 'Saket'
property with me.

2187
02:09:23,370 --> 02:09:24,540
-What I make from..
-Hey! Hey!

2188
02:09:24,580 --> 02:09:25,580
Stop it!

2189
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:27,080
What did you call me earlier?

2190
02:09:27,250 --> 02:09:28,250
A snake, right?

2191
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:31,540
Indeed, I am a venomous snake.

2192
02:09:31,910 --> 02:09:32,910
But...

2193
02:09:32,910 --> 02:09:35,200
there's that proverbial snake, that
bites the one struck by lightning.

2194
02:09:35,250 --> 02:09:36,620
I'm not that type.
Got it?

2195
02:09:38,540 --> 02:09:40,250
Okay.
Since you have requested so much,

2196
02:09:41,160 --> 02:09:42,540
I can reduce half a Crore.

2197
02:09:42,700 --> 02:09:43,700
So, it's 7.5 Crores.

2198
02:09:43,790 --> 02:09:44,790
No more bargaining.

2199
02:09:44,910 --> 02:09:45,910
This is final.

2200
02:09:46,080 --> 02:09:48,040
And you don't have to give
me anything hereafter,

2201
02:09:48,040 --> 02:09:49,620
in the name of this
silent partnership.

2202
02:09:49,660 --> 02:09:50,660
Okay?

2203
02:09:50,870 --> 02:09:53,040
Aren't you happy, bro?
This is all I can do!

2204
02:09:53,120 --> 02:09:54,500
Hey! In this situation,

2205
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:57,160
if I have to raise even a
penny more than three Crores,

2206
02:09:57,160 --> 02:09:58,830
I need to beg the
loan shark Marwadi.

2207
02:09:59,540 --> 02:10:02,000
I'll be ruined paying those
extremely high interests. Please!

2208
02:10:02,080 --> 02:10:06,580
So, the 116 resorts around the world
which you used to talk about, so far?

2209
02:10:06,620 --> 02:10:07,750
It was all bluff, brother!

2210
02:10:07,910 --> 02:10:08,910
Total bluff!

2211
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:11,080
Ram!

2212
02:10:11,830 --> 02:10:12,830
One minute.

2213
02:10:13,080 --> 02:10:14,120
Go!

2214
02:10:14,410 --> 02:10:15,450
Go ahead!

2215
02:10:21,330 --> 02:10:22,950
Bloody opportunistic dog!

2216
02:10:25,540 --> 02:10:26,540
What will we do?

2217
02:10:27,500 --> 02:10:29,040
Let's just agree to his conditions.

2218
02:10:29,580 --> 02:10:30,580
We don't have a choice.

2219
02:10:41,540 --> 02:10:42,580
I'm sorry.

2220
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:49,620
Let's go deal with him.

2221
02:10:51,160 --> 02:10:52,410
Childhood friend!

2222
02:10:54,790 --> 02:10:55,790
What's all this, dude?

2223
02:10:56,250 --> 02:10:57,370
It's his handiwork.

2224
02:11:01,580 --> 02:11:02,580
We are ready.

2225
02:11:03,620 --> 02:11:05,080
Don't misunderstand me, Mythili.

2226
02:11:06,120 --> 02:11:08,660
I won't take even a single Rupee
from what you're giving me.

2227
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:11,250
That is to destroy all
the evidence in this case,

2228
02:11:11,580 --> 02:11:14,120
and to maintain the
status quo for ages.

2229
02:11:14,330 --> 02:11:15,540
To the last shilling of it.

2230
02:11:16,200 --> 02:11:17,500
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

2231
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:20,330
Ram, just a minute.

2232
02:11:20,580 --> 02:11:22,080
-I have to tell you something.
-What?

2233
02:11:22,330 --> 02:11:23,870
Potty! In between this?

2234
02:11:24,250 --> 02:11:25,580
It's really urgent.

2235
02:11:25,620 --> 02:11:26,660
That's why.

2236
02:11:26,660 --> 02:11:28,450
-5 minutes. Come back quickly.
-That's fine.

2237
02:11:28,750 --> 02:11:29,750
Ram, come!

2238
02:11:30,910 --> 02:11:32,620
Prabha, you also come.

2239
02:11:35,750 --> 02:11:36,750
Mythili...

2240
02:11:38,410 --> 02:11:39,870
There was a servant here, right?

2241
02:11:40,330 --> 02:11:41,330
Yes.

2242
02:11:41,330 --> 02:11:42,370
There's a watchman.

2243
02:11:43,290 --> 02:11:46,290
He has gone to listen to
that Kothadiya's speech.

2244
02:11:46,790 --> 02:11:48,450
He'll come back only
in the afternoon.

2245
02:11:48,540 --> 02:11:49,540
Is he from this area?

2246
02:11:50,540 --> 02:11:51,540
No.

2247
02:11:51,660 --> 02:11:52,660
He came from Thane.

2248
02:11:52,870 --> 02:11:53,870
Oh, yes.

2249
02:11:54,250 --> 02:11:55,790
Praveen Kumar or Singh?

2250
02:11:56,120 --> 02:11:57,370
Pawanputra Bhede.

2251
02:11:57,410 --> 02:11:58,410
Yeah! Bhede!

2252
02:11:58,700 --> 02:12:00,120
Do you have his
documents with you?

2253
02:12:00,910 --> 02:12:03,250
I have copies of his
passport and Aadhaar card.

2254
02:12:03,910 --> 02:12:05,040
Good.
Bring it.

2255
02:12:05,160 --> 02:12:06,160
Okay.

2256
02:12:08,500 --> 02:12:09,500
Mythili!

2257
02:12:09,910 --> 02:12:11,580
You said he fired
the gun twice, right?

2258
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,410
Where all did the bullets strike?

2259
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:15,000
I have to recover
the bullet cases.

2260
02:12:15,700 --> 02:12:18,790
One hit the box with
Gandhiji's spectacles.

2261
02:12:19,160 --> 02:12:22,330
Another one hit the box which
had Safdar Hashmi's pen in it.

2262
02:12:25,750 --> 02:12:28,700
Both bullets have struck at
politically incorrect places.

2263
02:12:31,830 --> 02:12:33,000
What is it?

2264
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:34,540
Huh? Where are you going?
Stay there.

2265
02:12:35,250 --> 02:12:36,330
You stand here.

2266
02:12:39,250 --> 02:12:40,250
You ******!

2267
02:12:40,830 --> 02:12:44,120
You and her were fooling around on WhatsApp
and Insta for the past two years, huh?

2268
02:12:44,450 --> 02:12:45,500
You scoundrel!

2269
02:12:45,950 --> 02:12:49,080
Once, when Sudama came to his
friend Lord Krishna asking for help,

2270
02:12:49,410 --> 02:12:51,250
the Lord did greatly
help his friend.

2271
02:12:51,500 --> 02:12:52,500
But in return,

2272
02:12:53,250 --> 02:12:55,200
He didn't
ask for Sudama's wife!

2273
02:12:58,870 --> 02:13:00,620
Even though you are named Ram,

2274
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,200
you are still that
old Nair's son, right?

2275
02:13:04,200 --> 02:13:05,830
Ramkumar Nair!

2276
02:13:08,370 --> 02:13:09,370
Leave that.

2277
02:13:09,790 --> 02:13:11,500
If Kalyan has promised to solve this,

2278
02:13:11,660 --> 02:13:12,660
he will do it.

2279
02:13:12,870 --> 02:13:15,080
I'm sure about that.
He is that Advocate's son, right?

2280
02:13:15,790 --> 02:13:16,790
But...

2281
02:13:17,200 --> 02:13:18,790
if this Sudama intends to,

2282
02:13:19,200 --> 02:13:20,910
he can turn this game
on its head, right away.

2283
02:13:20,950 --> 02:13:21,750
Hey!

2284
02:13:21,790 --> 02:13:23,410
You have only one way.

2285
02:13:23,410 --> 02:13:24,660
Like him, make me also...

2286
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:26,250
... a Kubera!

2287
02:13:27,500 --> 02:13:28,540
What do you mean?

2288
02:13:28,830 --> 02:13:29,830
5 Crores!

2289
02:13:30,540 --> 02:13:32,330
5 Crores?

2290
02:13:33,500 --> 02:13:34,660
Dude!

2291
02:13:34,660 --> 02:13:37,620
Even Amitabh Bachchan gives away
5 Crores to 3rd runners up in KBC.

2292
02:13:37,620 --> 02:13:39,080
So don't tell me that.

2293
02:13:39,250 --> 02:13:40,910
It's not such a huge
sum in today's age.

2294
02:13:41,580 --> 02:13:43,120
Brahmand Solutions!

2295
02:13:43,410 --> 02:13:44,790
All debts cleared!

2296
02:13:44,830 --> 02:13:45,830
CEO,

2297
02:13:46,120 --> 02:13:47,500
Parameshwaran Potty.

2298
02:13:47,750 --> 02:13:49,120
P-O-T-T-Y.

2299
02:13:50,080 --> 02:13:53,200
And... I got a call earlier, right?

2300
02:13:53,870 --> 02:13:55,120
I had told him then,

2301
02:13:55,290 --> 02:13:57,450
that I had come to meet
Ramkumar at Vadakara.

2302
02:13:57,660 --> 02:13:59,700
So, don't think that
you can get rid of me.

2303
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Got it?

2304
02:14:01,660 --> 02:14:02,660
5 Crores!

2305
02:14:02,830 --> 02:14:03,830
Bank transfer.

2306
02:14:04,500 --> 02:14:06,120
I have nothing to lose.

2307
02:14:06,870 --> 02:14:07,870
Go.

2308
02:14:08,200 --> 02:14:09,200
Go downstairs.

2309
02:14:13,790 --> 02:14:14,790
Hey Ram!

2310
02:14:15,580 --> 02:14:16,580
Free lunch, huh?

2311
02:14:17,160 --> 02:14:18,580
Bloody dog!

2312
02:14:20,250 --> 02:14:21,250
Go!

2313
02:14:26,200 --> 02:14:28,120
So, it was you who
called Abdu here?

2314
02:14:33,870 --> 02:14:35,200
This condition is called,

2315
02:14:36,250 --> 02:14:38,540
floccinaucinihilipilification.

2316
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Shashi...

2317
02:14:42,080 --> 02:14:43,080
Tharoor!

2318
02:15:03,200 --> 02:15:04,750
Is the speed-boat
lying outside yours?

2319
02:15:05,200 --> 02:15:07,120
-Yes, it's mine.
-We'll need it.

2320
02:15:09,620 --> 02:15:10,620
Prabha...

2321
02:15:10,830 --> 02:15:14,910
Get me the overcoats and
hats of Hitler and Mussolini.

2322
02:15:17,250 --> 02:15:19,250
Mythili, this place should
be clean when we come back.

2323
02:15:19,290 --> 02:15:20,910
Not a speck of this
mess should remain.

2324
02:15:21,200 --> 02:15:23,500
Potty, watch whether someone
is coming from outside.

2325
02:15:23,500 --> 02:15:25,290
-Lock the gate from inside.
-Okay.

2326
02:15:28,500 --> 02:15:29,500
Ram!

2327
02:15:29,750 --> 02:15:30,750
Take this dagger,

2328
02:15:32,200 --> 02:15:33,620
and that piece of stone.

2329
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Bring them both.

2330
02:15:35,040 --> 02:15:36,040
What for?

2331
02:15:36,410 --> 02:15:37,540
Just do as I say!

2332
02:15:46,200 --> 02:15:48,000
The beach has good
visibility even at night.

2333
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:49,290
Even the sea is not 100% safe.

2334
02:15:49,370 --> 02:15:51,040
The beam from the
lighthouse is an issue.

2335
02:16:18,700 --> 02:16:19,700
Get up.

2336
02:16:22,330 --> 02:16:23,250
Take that dagger.

2337
02:16:23,290 --> 02:16:24,330
Jhansi Rani's dagger.

2338
02:16:25,750 --> 02:16:26,790
I won't touch the body.

2339
02:16:27,080 --> 02:16:28,450
Just do as I say.

2340
02:16:28,580 --> 02:16:29,580
Got me?

2341
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:38,120
What?

2342
02:16:38,790 --> 02:16:40,700
I get dizzy when I see blood.

2343
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:42,040
I'll faint.

2344
02:16:43,040 --> 02:16:44,450
Deja vu moment.

2345
02:16:45,120 --> 02:16:48,830
Nair, if people without a conscience,
start acting like they have conscience,

2346
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:50,410
it will not only be
difficult for them,

2347
02:16:50,410 --> 02:16:52,620
but also for the others
who are trying to help them out.

2348
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:55,580
So, stop this acting first.

2349
02:16:55,910 --> 02:16:56,950
Come here.

2350
02:16:57,750 --> 02:16:58,750
Come on!

2351
02:16:59,870 --> 02:17:00,870
Sit down.

2352
02:17:01,580 --> 02:17:02,580
Sit down.

2353
02:17:03,660 --> 02:17:05,790
What are you waiting for?
Cut him open.

2354
02:17:05,790 --> 02:17:06,830
Come on!

2355
02:17:11,790 --> 02:17:12,870
From the side...

2356
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:16,160
Do it properly!

2357
02:17:16,910 --> 02:17:17,910
Cut through the sides.

2358
02:17:19,830 --> 02:17:21,040
Open him up properly.

2359
02:17:22,750 --> 02:17:23,750
Open it.

2360
02:17:25,580 --> 02:17:26,870
Put that stone
inside his stomach.

2361
02:17:26,910 --> 02:17:27,910
Keep it inside.

2362
02:17:33,160 --> 02:17:34,500
Now tie it up with the cloth.

2363
02:17:35,290 --> 02:17:36,290
Tighten it on that side.

2364
02:17:39,410 --> 02:17:40,410
Get up.

2365
02:17:42,790 --> 02:17:44,120
Throw the body into the water.

2366
02:17:53,330 --> 02:17:54,370
Go ahead.

2367
02:17:55,500 --> 02:17:56,580
Come on!

2368
02:18:13,370 --> 02:18:15,410
Now we have to leave this
Hitler & Mussolini in the sea.

2369
02:18:15,450 --> 02:18:16,450
Don't leave any trace.

2370
02:18:47,330 --> 02:18:49,000
Why are you crying
like this, you loser?

2371
02:18:49,330 --> 02:18:51,250
You've joined the club of
celebrated murderers now.

2372
02:18:51,250 --> 02:18:52,290
Be proud!

2373
02:18:52,290 --> 02:18:53,750
That's your only option.

2374
02:18:54,580 --> 02:18:55,950
There won't be any
problem, right?

2375
02:18:57,040 --> 02:18:58,040
Will he come back?

2376
02:18:58,660 --> 02:19:00,790
Usually the body comes back
on the third day, right?

2377
02:19:01,330 --> 02:19:02,330
Nothing like that.

2378
02:19:02,660 --> 02:19:05,080
Marakkar is supposed to be
the Lion of Arabian Sea, right?

2379
02:19:05,120 --> 02:19:07,040
The lions of the sea,
will be taken by the sea herself.

2380
02:19:07,080 --> 02:19:08,080
Come.

2381
02:19:18,950 --> 02:19:19,950
So, as I said...

2382
02:19:20,700 --> 02:19:21,750
When will you leave?

2383
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:23,160
We'll leave immediately.

2384
02:19:24,290 --> 02:19:25,290
Ram, come.

2385
02:19:30,950 --> 02:19:31,950
When are you leaving?

2386
02:19:32,910 --> 02:19:33,910
Day after.

2387
02:19:34,080 --> 02:19:36,200
My tickets are
booked for that day.

2388
02:19:36,450 --> 02:19:37,500
Don't skip that.

2389
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:39,370
Before you reach the airport,

2390
02:19:39,410 --> 02:19:41,120
that transfer I asked
for, should happen.

2391
02:19:42,200 --> 02:19:44,450
To the UAE Hinduja bank
account of my wife,

2392
02:19:44,450 --> 02:19:46,540
you will deposit money from
your Swiss Bank account.

2393
02:19:46,750 --> 02:19:49,410
Then, it will be transferred to my wife's
NRI account in some godforsaken bank here,

2394
02:19:49,450 --> 02:19:51,000
from where I'll withdraw it.

2395
02:19:52,160 --> 02:19:53,450
Just a trick
from your own book.

2396
02:19:54,080 --> 02:19:55,120
And...

2397
02:19:55,330 --> 02:19:56,700
don't try to act smart with me.

2398
02:19:57,160 --> 02:19:58,870
An extradition from the UK,

2399
02:19:59,080 --> 02:20:00,540
is not so difficult anymore.

2400
02:20:02,290 --> 02:20:03,290
Come here, all of you.

2401
02:20:05,450 --> 02:20:06,450
Now, relax.

2402
02:20:06,660 --> 02:20:07,660
Don't worry.

2403
02:20:08,410 --> 02:20:10,080
If I say that I'll manage it,
I'll do it.

2404
02:20:10,870 --> 02:20:11,910
You know, right?

2405
02:20:22,500 --> 02:20:23,500
Shall I leave?

2406
02:20:54,870 --> 02:20:55,910
Hail Lord Ram!

2407
02:20:58,540 --> 02:20:59,830
What happened on your face, sir?

2408
02:20:59,870 --> 02:21:00,910
It's nothing.

2409
02:21:02,200 --> 02:21:05,660
It was a superb speech by
Lakshman Kothadiyaji, Madam.

2410
02:21:06,450 --> 02:21:07,700
Why are you back so early?

2411
02:21:08,410 --> 02:21:10,410
Didn't you say that you'll
come only by afternoon?

2412
02:21:11,200 --> 02:21:12,660
Didn't you go to
your uncle's house?

2413
02:21:12,660 --> 02:21:14,120
I went there, Madam.

2414
02:21:14,290 --> 02:21:16,000
I had a blast with my friends.

2415
02:21:16,540 --> 02:21:17,950
I got drunk last night.

2416
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:19,160
I had a lot of fun.

2417
02:21:19,200 --> 02:21:20,660
So much fun at night.

2418
02:21:21,160 --> 02:21:24,580
There was a party happening
here last night, right sir?

2419
02:21:26,450 --> 02:21:28,080
Okay.
Go and clean the garden.

2420
02:21:28,790 --> 02:21:30,200
One more thing, sir.

2421
02:21:31,330 --> 02:21:34,370
While I was sleeping on
the beach last night,

2422
02:21:34,500 --> 02:21:40,200
I saw two people going
to the sea on our boat.

2423
02:21:40,870 --> 02:21:44,370
Since I was really drunk,
I fell asleep over there.

2424
02:21:44,410 --> 02:21:48,250
I thought I'll go and
check in the morning.

2425
02:21:50,120 --> 02:21:51,200
Then?

2426
02:21:52,040 --> 02:21:54,120
But... in the morning...

2427
02:21:56,450 --> 02:21:59,120
I woke up in the morning,
hearing a ruckus.

2428
02:22:00,830 --> 02:22:01,950
When I looked,

2429
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,200
some people and the police
had crowded on the beach.

2430
02:22:06,120 --> 02:22:07,870
When I went forward
to get a closer look,

2431
02:22:07,910 --> 02:22:10,120
I saw someone's chopped off hand.

2432
02:22:21,290 --> 02:22:23,290
-Sir, someone is here to see you.
-Who?

2433
02:22:23,540 --> 02:22:25,160
Who are you?
Sir wants to know.

2434
02:22:25,580 --> 02:22:27,700
Tell him that I'm his friend.
He knows me.

2435
02:22:27,750 --> 02:22:29,870
Sir, he's saying that he's your friend.

2436
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:31,450
-Send him in.
-Okay.

2437
02:22:31,910 --> 02:22:33,040
You may go in.

2438
02:22:36,830 --> 02:22:39,040
Has anyone here seen this
tattooed hand earlier?

2439
02:22:42,700 --> 02:22:45,500
-Have you?
-But I didn't tell them anything, sir.

2440
02:22:46,120 --> 02:22:49,200
At night, our boat was on that side.

2441
02:22:49,910 --> 02:22:52,200
But when I checked now in the morning,
it's on this side.

2442
02:22:52,620 --> 02:22:56,330
When I checked inside the boat
to find where it went at night,

2443
02:22:56,370 --> 02:22:57,790
I found this, sir.

2444
02:22:58,250 --> 02:23:00,450
There's something written
in Malayalam in this.

2445
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:06,500
The moon was shattered,
And moonlight, erased...

2446
02:23:07,040 --> 02:23:09,620
Didn't someone come to
meet you last night, sir?

2447
02:23:09,660 --> 02:23:10,660
Who is he?

2448
02:23:12,200 --> 02:23:14,200
I know everything!

2449
02:23:15,790 --> 02:23:17,580
But I won't tell anyone anything, sir.

2450
02:23:18,040 --> 02:23:20,410
He was a Turk, right?
Bloody Pakistani!

2451
02:23:20,620 --> 02:23:21,750
He deserved to die!

2452
02:23:23,910 --> 02:23:26,370
But I have a small request.

2453
02:23:26,910 --> 02:23:29,500
My mother is not well at all.
She is bedridden.

2454
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:33,040
I haven't been able to go
to my hometown for two years.

2455
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:34,620
For her treatment,

2456
02:23:35,250 --> 02:23:37,040
I need some money.

2457
02:23:37,910 --> 02:23:38,950
Very little.

2458
02:23:38,950 --> 02:23:40,200
For the hospital expenses.

2459
02:23:40,410 --> 02:23:41,410
How much?

2460
02:23:42,580 --> 02:23:43,580
50,000.

2461
02:23:43,830 --> 02:23:45,160
50,000 Rupees.

2462
02:23:47,500 --> 02:23:48,500
We will give it.

2463
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:50,040
Every month.

2464
02:23:50,790 --> 02:23:52,160
Every month,

2465
02:23:52,700 --> 02:23:54,580
50,000 Rupees!

2466
02:23:56,040 --> 02:23:57,410
In cash.

2467
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,290
When you kill the powerless,

2468
02:24:01,790 --> 02:24:03,660
they win the war
with their very own death.

2469
02:24:11,620 --> 02:24:12,700
Hail Lord Ram!

2470
02:24:13,410 --> 02:24:16,950
'THEERPPU'
The Settlement

2471
02:24:28,830 --> 02:24:30,120
Hello?
Cantonment police station!

2472
02:24:30,160 --> 02:24:31,160
Hello?

2473
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:32,500
I had called earlier.

2474
02:24:33,040 --> 02:24:34,040
What's the matter?

2475
02:24:34,700 --> 02:24:36,540
A man-missing case,
in Vadakara.

2476
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:38,750
I've already
registered a complaint.

2477
02:24:38,790 --> 02:24:40,200
I wanted to know about that.

2478
02:24:40,370 --> 02:24:41,500
Madam, say the name.

2479
02:24:41,540 --> 02:24:42,660
I am Dr. Shwetha.

2480
02:24:42,660 --> 02:24:44,410
Dr. Shwetha...
Not that!

2481
02:24:44,450 --> 02:24:46,040
Say the name of
the missing person!

2482
02:24:46,040 --> 02:24:48,040
Abdullah.
Abdullah Marakkar.

2483
02:24:48,580 --> 02:24:59,250
âª Where History once slept
and rose in peace.., âª

2484
02:25:01,950 --> 02:25:10,450
âª Recent wrongs
have castled up. âª

2485
02:25:19,410 --> 02:25:24,080
âª Old wounds fester here, now, âª

2486
02:25:24,120 --> 02:25:32,040
âª By the salty waves
of the sea of sin..; âª

2487
02:25:32,080 --> 02:25:35,870
âª On this night.., âª

2488
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:44,750
âª Thisâ¦ very night! âª

2489
02:25:49,910 --> 02:26:02,330
âª If happenstanceâ¦
joins hands with destiny.., here, âª

2490
02:26:02,500 --> 02:26:06,580
âª Itâs Apocalypseâ¦! âª

2491
02:26:06,620 --> 02:26:15,750
âª That blood-stained finale, âª

2492
02:26:16,120 --> 02:26:22,120
âª itâd be unimaginable! âª

2493
02:26:22,700 --> 02:26:33,290
âª Suchâ¦ is the swelling
surge of the past.., âª

2494
02:26:33,580 --> 02:26:39,660
âª The battle song of Karma! âª

2495
02:26:40,120 --> 02:26:44,080
âª The end of story? âª

2496
02:26:44,540 --> 02:26:57,250
âª Beyond beliefâ¦.!!! âª

2497
02:26:57,580 --> 02:27:10,750
âª Beyond beliefâ¦.!!! âª
